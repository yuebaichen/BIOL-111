4 vertebrates characteristics:
    1. axial skeleton: cranium (skull), vertebral column (spine), ribs
    2. appendicular skeleton: pectoral girdle, pelvic girdle (bony structure to which limbs of verts are attached)
    3. closed circ sys: ventral heart
    4. organs suspended in coelom

fish circ. sys: 2 heart chambers
    - strong muscular pump that maintains blood flow (located ventrally)
    - SV (sinus venosus) -> atrium (dorsal) -> ventricle (ventral) -> BA (bulbous arteriosus)
    - one-way valves inside heart: prevents back-flow

fish vs amphibian circ:
    - fish: 2-chambered heart
        - blood oxygenated in gills
        - single circuit circulation (reduced pressure)
        - flaw: blood is not under pressure after exiting to the gills (gets through slowly based on muscle contractions & passive flow)
    - amphibians: 3-chambered heart
        - blood oxygenated in lungs & skin
        - double circuit circulation: pulmonary (lung) & systemic (body)
        - advantages: blood is now under higher pressure than fish (can repressurize blood after going through lungs)
        - disadvantages blood is mixed (no septum to fully devide ventricle)

4 possible reasons why we moved to land:
    1. devonian droughts (~400 Mya): shallow inland seas/swamps/ponds, low dissolved O2 
    2. inc competition in water: crowding in small pools
    3. new food sources on land: arthropods, plants
    4. no vert predators on land (compared to in water)

5 difference between life on land vs water:
    1. availability of water/moisture: a lot less moisture on land
    2. density of medium: no medium to float in
        - 2 tetrapod solutions:
                1. better skeletal support: fight gravity (stronger limbs, vertebral column to hold up body, ribs to hold up body cavity)
                2. more efficient circulatory system: 3+ chambered heart, double circuit of blood flow
    3. amt of oxygen: easier to get oxygen
    4. stability of temp: need to thermoregulate
    5. amt of UV radiation: mechanisms to reduce DNA damage caused by UV

2 advantages of terrestrial respiration:
    1. air has higher concentration of oxygen than water
    2. gases diffuse faster in air than water
    - lung evolution: lobe-finned fishes
        - 2 ventral pockets formed off of the esophagus: swim bladder evolved as connection from gut -> formed into lungs
        - intially used as a supplemental resp device
        - why we choke: our lungs evolved as projection off of our gut, pathway for food and air is shared at parts

3 innovations of reptiles:
    1. more efficient heart: partial septum, 2 aorta
    2. special nitrogenous waste: uric acid
    3. aminotic egg: embryo surrounded by extra embryonic layers

4 main ways of heat loss/gain:
    1. conduction: from surface you're sitting on
    2. radiation: heat from sun radiation
    3. evaporation: evaporative cooling off body
    4. convection: wind blowing & removing heat via convection

2 sources of body heat:
    1. ectotherms: absorb EXTERNAL heat & ridding it to the env passively
    2. endotherms: generate their own INTERNAL heat via METABOLIC processes

3 ways of thermoregulation:
    1. behavioural: moving
    2. physiological: sweating, panting, shivering
    3. physical: insulation, colour, SA:vol (allen's rule)

4 independent evolution of flight:
    1. insects
    2. pterosaurs
    3. birds
    4. bats

3 innovations to fly:
    1. hollow bones
    2. sternum/breastbone enlarged & keeled (projection to allow for bigger muscle attachment)
    3. feathers

3 unique features specific to mammals:
    1. hair: insulation, camouflage, sensory & defence, display (hair & feathers evolved independently: completely separate evolutionary solutions to insulation)
    2. sweat glands
    3. mammary glands: milk production (hence the name mammals)

4 other features of mammals:
    1. endothermic, 4-chambered heart (not completely homeothermic, body temp drops during hibernation)
    2. "advanced" nervous system
    3. internal fertilization
    4. unlike fish & reptiles, mammals show heterodonty (massive variation in teeth specialized for diff tasks)
        - specialized teeth among species reflects varied diets

2 possible reasons why the pleistocene mammals/megafauna (megatherium, smilodon, etc) went extinct:
    1. hunting by humans (or climate + human-caused fires)
        - fossils of mammoths & stuff stabbed w/ big spear points
        - evidence shows locations of fires correlated with location of extinctios
            - climate dried env + human setting fires -> extinction (disappearance of megafauna (large/giant animals) coincided with major fire episodes)
            - fires have massive effects on shaping terrestrial ecosystems & humans historically have hugely modified env in NA by burning
            - however fires weren't everywhere so it can't be the sole explanation (however, it matches to the events in LA)
    2. climate change (end of ice age)

4 types of excretory products:
    1. salt, ions
    2. water
    3. fecal mater
    4. nitrogenous wastes
