L20 - 5.1: verts 1 - "fishes"

common traits:
    - between deuterostomes: pharyngeal slits
        - located on lateral surface of head
        - seems to be ancestral trait of deuterostomes
        - lost in echinoderms
        - pharyngeal tissue supported by arches in vertebrates
        - function of pharyngeal slits (pouches):
            - filter feeding for primitive species (lancelets)
            - respiration in vertebrates:
                - water coming through mouth passes through slits
                - O2 & CO2 can be exchanged across a respiratory surface (gills)
    - between chordata:
        - dorsal hollow nerve chord
        - notochord
        - muscular post-anal tail

vertebrates characteristics:
    - axial skeleton: cranium (skull), vertebral column (spine), ribs
    - appendicular skeleton: pectoral girdle, pelvic girdle (bony structure to which limbs of verts are attached)
    - closed circ sys: ventral heart
    - organs suspended in coelom

fish characteristics:
    1. gill slits & gill arches:
        - pharyngeal slits -> gill slits
        - bars between slits = gill arches (bony arch structure that support the gill filaments, and also have gill rakers used for filter-feeding for some species)
            - made of bone/cartilage
            - gill filaments are on the gill arches
                - gill filaments: thin filaments that extract oxygen from water
        - bony fishes have 4 pairs of gill arches each with many pairs of gill filaments (gills covered by operculum)
        - gill filament structure: thin, vascularized, high SA
            - blood vessels flow through gill arches
            - capillary beds in gill fillaments: gas exchange
            - filament epithelium is 1 cell thick (1-2 um)
            - water & blood flow in opposing directions: countercurrent exchange
                - ensures partial pressure gradients are maintained
                - achieves maximum exchange of gases (O2 & CO2)
                - countercurrect exchange has evolved many times: limbs (prevent heat loss), kidney (transfer of ions & waste), swim bladder (evolved into lungs)
    2. fish circ sys:
        - closed sys: (SINGLE CIRCUIT)
            - away from gills: gills -> dorsal aorta -> arteries -> arterioles -> capillaries
            - toward gills: capillaries -> venules -> veins -> heart -> ventral aorta -> gills
            - 2 fish heart chambers:  
                - strong muscular pump that maintains blood flow (located ventrally)
                - SV (sinus venosus) -> atrium (dorsal) -> ventricle (ventral) -> BA (bulbous arteriosus)
                - one-way valves inside heart: prevents back-flow

2 types of fishes: "fish" diversity (NOT MONOPHYLETIC)
    1. agnathans ("jawless fish"): vertebrates but not gnathostomes (jawed verts)
        - 2 groups:
            - characteristics:
                - NO JAWS 
                - cartilaginous skeleton, notochord present, gill slits
                - NO FINS
                - no swim bladder, no scales
            1. hagfish (mixinoidea): 
                - tongue-like projection has teeth-like rasps
                - scavengers
                - osmotic concentration (solute concentration) same as seawater
                - used in leather products
                - knot tying: to tear of food
                - mucous production (produce massive amounts of mucous)
            2. lamprey (petromyzontoidea):
                - no jaw: has "oral disk" instead
                - very distinct larval state: ammocoete
                - adults of many species are parasitic on fishes
                - are anadramous: swim upstream from sea to spawn
                - colonization of great lakes lead to massive decline in lake trout & other fishes
    2. gnathostomes: jawed verts
        - info on jaws:
            - not present in early fishes & extant agnathans
            - evolved from anterior gill arches (which is why sharks have fewer gill slits)
            - teeth evolved from scales in mouth
            - greatly improved feeding ability & diversity
        - have paired fins
            - located on pectoral & pelvic limb girdles (also has dorsal fins, caudal fin, anal fin)
            - enabled more active swimming
            - used for steering, stabalizing, lift
            - swimming via undulation (whole body) -> oscillation (just tail)
            - great diversity of fins and how it impacted diversity
        1. cartilaginous fishes ("chondrichthyes"): sharks, skates, rays
            - general info:
                - mostly marine
                - no swim bladder!!! (that comes later)
                - predators, scavengers, filter feeders
            - important features:
                - jaws
                - paired fins
                - 5-7 gill slits
                - presence of SCALES (later evolved into feathers)
            - sharks: high diversity (smallest living shark: 16cm dwarf lantern shark -> largest living shark: 18m whale shark)
                - example: cookie cutter shark
                    - cuts circles of flesh out of victims - fish, seals, etc. (attacks submarines...)
            - skates & rays: some predatory, some filter feeders
                - examples: big skate, manta ray, sting ray, shovelnose guitarfish
        2. bony fishes ("osteichthyes"): very diverse group of fishes with solid bone
            - general info:
                - highly diverse: largest vert group
                - have jaws, opercula, paired fins, scales, SWIM BLADDER, INTERNAL BONY SKELETON!!
                    - swim bladder: floatation device enabling neutral bouyancy 
                        - regulated by swallowing/burping air OR by gas gland in swim bladder
                        - later evolved into tetrapod LUNGS!!!
            - 2 groups of bony fish:
                1. ray-finned fishes (actinopterygians): teleosts, most fishes (fins have cartilaginous rays)
                    - cool teleosts: 4 eyed fish, archer fish, worlds smallest fish, gulper eel
                        - deep sea anglerfish: 700-1k meters deep, bioluminescent lures, pheromones (secreted/excreted chemicals that trigger social response)
                            - "parasitic" males bite on and bloodstream fuses with female (male acts as small bag of sperm)
                2. lobe-finned fishes (sarcopterygians): lungfish, coelacanths
                    - example: coelacants (actinistia) - "living fossil"
                        - thought to be extinct (65 Mya)
                        - 1938: found on South African trawler
                        - 1998: 2nd species found in indonesian fish market
                    - example: lungfish (we didn't evolve from them but they're pretty close to what our ancestors looked like)
                        - 6 species (africa, SA, australia)
                        - "walk" on lobe fins: tetrapod motion
                        - breathe through gills & primitive lungs (hence lungfish)
                        - estivate (state of dormancy through hot/dry period) in mud through droughts

summary of how fishes got better, stronger, & faster:
    1. get more oxygen -> gills, heart
    2. get that skeleton on the INSIDE!! -> endoskeleton
    3. JAWS!!! (gnathostomata)
    4. paired fins -> better locomotion (gnathostomata)

intro video:
    - pink salmon:
        - females will occupy space to build & defend their nests ("redds") and remain stationary to prevent other females from digging up their eggs
        - group of males go from female to female to compete for sperm placement
            - female places vent down to release eggs -> males rush in to release sperm (milt)
            - fish perform gaping to sync gamete release
            - female performs covering digs to bury eggs in sediment
            - whitefish specialize in eating pink salmon eggs after spawning
            - lots of predators feed on baby pink salmon (parr -> smolt) as they migrate down towards ocean (ie northern pike)
    - stickleback fish: males are caregivers and care for nest while femals only come by to deposit eggs
