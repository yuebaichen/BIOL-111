L23 - 5.4: verts 4 - birds: how to occupy extreme env & fly?

big ideas for aves:
    - how to occupy extreme envs?: thermoregulation
    - how to get in the air?: feathers, better lungs, lighter bones

probable ancestor to birds: theropod dinosaur (flesh eating dinos characterized by hollow limbs & 3 toes/claws on each limb)
    - shared characteristics btwn birds & dino ancestor:
        - bipedal, 3 hind toes
        - carnivorous
        - 4 chambered heart
        - similar lungs
        - feathers
        - hollow bones
        - parental care of eggs & juveniles
    - evolutionary cousin to birds (not ancestor, we don't know the actual ancestor): archaeopteryx ("ancient wing")
        - ~150 Mya (jurrasic period)
        - 12+ fossil specimens
        - crow-sized
        - bird (avian) characteristics of arc'teryx: feathers & wings
        - non-avian characteristics of arc'teryx: teeth & bony tail

general bird info:
    - ~9.6k species
    - amniotes
    - endothermic (warm-blooded, can regulate heat internally)
    - 4-chambered heart w/ completely separate pulmonary & systemic circuits
    - have feathers & most fly
    - diverse beaks (evolution of beak linked to diversification as it ties to feeding styles/capabilities)
        - diverse diets: carnivores, herbivores, nectivores, scavengers
        - evolution of beak -> anatomical variation -> natural selection -> diversity
        - example: darwin's finches
            - mini-radiation of beaks to generate diff adaptations to feed on diff things
    - diverse feet modified for running, grappling, swimming, etc

thermoregulation: body temp control
    - 4 main ways of heat loss/gain:
        1. conduction: from surface you're sitting on
        2. radiation: heat from sun radiation
        3. evaporation: evaporative cooling off body
        4. convection: wind blowing & removing heat via convection
    - 2 sources of body heat:
        1. ectotherms: absorb EXTERNAL heat & ridding it to the env passively
        2. endotherms: generate their own INTERNAL heat via METABOLIC processes
    - how do endotherms generate heat?: due to our poor metabolic efficiency -> generates excess heat (lose NRG when converting food to ATP or ATP to ADP)
        - we're able to keep ourselves warm because we're BAD at metabolism (also means it's costly to keep warm)
    - cool fact: camera traps use infra-red movement detection to turn on infra-red camera (infra-red array lights up scene with infra-red light so camera can see)
    - endotherm vs ectotherm is not the same as hemeotherm (const body temp) & heterotherm (variable temp, allow body temp to fluctuate)
        - endotherms often maintain constant body temp
            - not always: endotherms can drop body temp significantly during hibernation
            - bees arent endotherms but can generate heat by fake flying
        - endotherm metabolism works overtime when surrounding temp is lower or higher than its body temp to generate/get rid of heat
            - metabolism is lowest when at preferred heat
        - ectotherms metabolism increases as temp increases
            - body temp is 1-1 linear relationship to env temp (cold turtle won't move but warm turtle can move fast)
    - 3 broad classes/mechanisms of thermoregulation:
        1. behavioural:
            - orientation relative to heat source, basking, huddling, & varying contact w/ heat source
            - moving locations throughout the day
            - example: lizards
                - maintains body temp btwn lower & upper limits by moving btwn hot & cold microhabitats 
                - usually maintain body temp different to that of env
            - example: japanese macaque - goes into hot spring in winter for warmth (famous tourist attraction)
            - example: emperor penguins (huddles together in -60 deg C but sometimes gets too warm so they disperse -> huge release of vapor)
        2. physiological:
            - too hot -> inc blood flow to periphery, sweating, panting (blood carries most of heat so preventing it from reaching SA prevents losing heat to outside)
            - too cold -> dec blood flow to periphery, shiver
            - example: human thermostat
                - negative feedback system in hypothalamus (maintains homeostasis, stable eqm)
                - if temp too high -> sweat -> evaporative cooling
                - if temp too low -> shiver -> generate metabolic heat
        3. physical:
            - insulation (fur, feathers, fat)
            - SA to vol ratio
                - modify size through evolution to inc/dec SA:vol ratio based on env (colder -> bigger, hotter -> smaller)
            - colour
            - example: amt of fur, fat, SA differences 
                - Allen's rule: thicker limbs & appendages in cold climates to improve SA:volume ratio
                - example: jack rabbit
                    - long vascularized ears to rid of heat in hot (convective & evaporative cooling can occur via blood vessels flowing to extremeties)
                - example: arctic hare
                    - short ears & thick limbs - don't want to lose heat through extremeties
        - other thermoregulation techniques:
            - counter-current heat exchangers: whale tongue, mammal foot, flippers
            - store fat as brown adipose tissues (can then metabolism to keep warm)
        
respiration:
    - flying/swimming & endothermy demand high amt of oxygen
    - some birds able to high at extremely high altitudes (>30k feet, bar-headed geese flying over himalayas)
    - consequently, bird resp sys has evolved to be much more complex & efficient than mammals
    - resp sys:
        - UNIDIRECTIONAL flow of air thorugh lungs
        - numerous sacs (8-9) - made up of anterior & posterior sacs (NOT LUNGS, no resp surfaces)
    - bird ventiliation (aka breathing): 
        - birds don't have tidal flow: air doesnt go in and out with every breath
        - takes 2 cycles/breaths for air to go in and out (breathe in and out)
        - human lungs exchange a drastically smaller percentage of the air we breath compared to birds
        1. breath 1: air drawn into posterior sacs (inhalation), air propelled through lungs from posterior sac (exhalation)
        2. breath 2: same air drawn into anterior sacs from lungs (inhalation), same air propelled out through nares/nostrils (exhalation)

evolution of flight: enabled by efficient resp sys
    - flight has evolved at least 4 times (independently):
        1. insects
        2. pterosaurs (not dinosaurs but around the same time, evolved much bigger flying things than exists today)
        3. birds
        4. bats
        - NOTE: flying is NOT the same as gliding
            - flying is POWERED flight, using muscles to flap wings
            - gliding is passive (flying squirrels/lemurs/fish/reptiles/etc) but is still very cool
                - flying fish jump out of water, spread their fins, and glide across water thanks to the ground effect (when chased by predator)
                - flying lizard spreads out its ribs with flaps of skin to glide through air
                - gliding frog has spread out webs in btwn toes that help them glide from tree to tree
                - gliding snakes climb up trees, jump off & spread their bodies to glide long distances
    - convergent evolution of flight:
        - similarities due to common env, not a common ancestor
        - not closely related organisms independently evolve similar features
    - 3 main adaptations for flight:
        1. hollow bones (w/ struts to provide structural support, can be strong yet very light)
        2. sternum (breastbone) enlarged & keeled (keel: projection on sternum serving as anchor for wing muscle attachments)
            - inc SA for attachment of large flight muscles
        3. feathers
            - therapod dinos had feathers for insulation: birds likely evolved feathers not for flight but for insulation
            - functions: insulation, flight, sensory structures, nest lining (all evolved from scales)
            - composed of B-keratin derived from scales (mentioned in 5-3, evolved in reptiles)
            - most birds have reptile-like scaled skin on their legs rather than feathers
            - have evolved feathers for all types of purposes (tail, flight, semiplume, filoplume, bristle, downy)
    did flight evolve from ground-up or trees-down?:
        - ground-up hypothesis: dinos were running around & started flapping for wtv reason -> gliding -> eventually flight
            - direct support for ground-up: chukars (are partridges - medium-sized galliform (heavy-bodied & ground-feeding) bird)
                - chukars are poor fliers: have short stubby wings & tire easily
                - hatchlings run from danger, often up steep inclines & flapping their wings
                - angle of flapping created traction rather than lift ("wing-assisted incline running") - perhaps later evolved into flying
            - dinos were blisteringly fast on land, evolving primitive flight to take a little load off feet can greatly improve speed
                - primitive dino feathers for ornamentation and insulation shown to improve running speed and leaping height by DOUBLE
                    - feathers would be very favourable under pressure of natural selection -> flight
        - trees-down hypothesis: arboreal dinosaurs leaped down from trees -> started gliding -> started flapping -> eventually flight
            - however they'd have to evolve to be arboreal first in order to climb up trees to jump down from them
            - non-avian dinosaurs had no trace of any arboreal adaptations, only had anatomy for high-speed chase running
        - cool fact: bats showed no transitionary fossil since their appearacne 55 Mya
            - bats were intially arboreal whereas birds & pterosaurs had a ground up start
            - this is why bats are so poor at flying (less efficient) compared to birds & pterosaurs

intro video:
    - dark-eyed junco: altricial birds (takes long time to develop in nest)
    - common merganser: diving fish predators
    - common loon: large numbers of failed breeders congregate at lake to forage on sticklback fish
    - killdeer: covers babies under itself
    - eagles tend to be scavengers
    - white-bearded manakin: males clear a little space on forest floor & does jumping dance between branches to impress females
    - pelican: lunge beaks into water or dive in water to catch fish
    - potoo: turns into branch looking form
    - vultures: can eat a lot of food (rotten food, scavengers) but have trouble getting into carcass
    - swallow: sometimes cavity nest in logs (will feed young then bring out waste)
