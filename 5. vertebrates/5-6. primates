L25 - 5.6: verts 6 - mammals II: primates!!! hominids & CNS

general primate info:
    - mostly likely had arboreal ancestor
    - ~230-270 species
    - grasping limbs with opposable thumbs (unique to primates)
    - forward facing eyes (w/ depth perception):
        - usually trait of predators, prey have side facing eyes
    - big cerebrum/brain
    - highly social

2 major groups of primates: 48% of primate species in danger of extinction within next decade
    1. prosimians:
        - mostly arboreal & nocturnal
        - once found on all continents, now only in madagascar (lemurs), africa, SE asia
        - lemurs in madagascar have radiated: not all arboreal, some diurnal (active during day)
        - many species are threatened/endangered
        - examples: galago, loris
    2. anthropoids:
        1. new world monkeys: post-columbus
            - most have prehensile tail (tail that can grasp/hold objects)
            - have flat noses & tend to be arboreal
            - example: spider monkey (panama), engaging/active/frantic critters that are also little shits
            - example: vervet (barbados), not native species & was brought to SA from africa
        2. old world monkeys: pre-columbus
            - do not have prehensile tails
            - examples:
                - long-tailed macaques (indonesia): will hiss at tourists for food
                - baboon (south africa): everyone tries to grab the baby away to climb social hierarchy in troop
                - vervet (south africa): fed up mother grabs tail of young to keep them from escaping
            - subgroups of old world monkeys lack tails
            1. gibbons: smaller than other apes, mostly arboreal
            2. orangutangs: too heavy to swing on trees, must climb down & walk btwn trees, spends most of time on ground
            3. african apes: incl. gorillas, chimps, homonids
    - tarsiers (bush baby) sandwiched in between the two and is closer to prosimians (details not important)
        - phylogenetic position uncertain
        - among the smallest primates
        - are the only entirely carnivorous primate
        - fossils found in asia, europe, NA
    
hominids: 5 stages
    1. ardipithecus:
        - fossils of ardipithecine ancestor dating 4.4 Mya uncovered in 2009
        - could walk upright w/o arms as chimps do, but still retained "primitive" big toe that could grasp tree like ape 
    2. australopithecus (gracile australopithecines): all extinct
        - brain size 35% that of humans
        1. A. afarensis: "lucy" skeleton from 3.5 Mya provided evidence that BIPEDALISM EVOLVED BEFORE BRAINS fully evolved
        2. A. africanus
    3. paranthropus (robust australopithecines)
    4. early homo:
        1. H. habilis ("handy/skillful): 
            - lived 2.5-1.5 Mya in Africa 
            - first tool use 2 Mya
            - had shorter jaw & bigger brain
        2. H. ergaster
        3. H. erectus ("standing"): 
            - believed to be first hominid to leave Africa into Eurasia
            - lived 1.6-.25 Mya
            - first fire use
            - same size as humans but w/ smaller brain & thicker skull
    5. recent homo:
        1. H. heidelbergensis
        2. H. neanderthalensis:
            - discovered in Neander valley, Germany
            - coexisted w/ H. sapiens but disappeared ~30 Kya
            - had short, stalky, but powerful build w/ brains larger than humans
        3. H. floresiensis: 
            - found in Flores, Indonesia 
            - survived until ~60 Kya & possibly wiped out by volcanic eruption
        4. H. sapiens:
            - arose 200 Kya in East Africa
            - spread out to Eurasia then to rest of the world
            - larger brains than early homo species w/ increasingly social lives
            - likely had rare breeding events with neanderthals and other homo species (melanesians & denisovans)
                - DNA from other homo species has been in decline since some of their alleles inc risk of certain diseases
                - however there are cases where other homo species DNA has been integrated (denisovan-like DNA in tibetans to help with higher altitude)

mammalian nervous system:
    1. central nervous system (CNS):
        - dorsal, hollow tube of nervous tissue:
            - large cephalic ganglion (brain)
            - long tube inferior to it (spinal cord)
            - both brain & spinal cord protected by bone
    2. peripheral nervous system (PNS):
        - sys of lateral nerves:
            - cranial nerves from brain 
            - spinal nerves from spinal cord
    - CNS input & output:
        - conscious (sensory info, neural afferents, info to CNS) -> CNS -> voluntary (commands to muscles, neural efferents, info out of CNS)
        - unconscious (physiological info: blood pressure, deep body temp) -> CNS -> autonomis (autonomic commands: HR, sweating, saliva)
        - hormones -> CNS -> neurohormones
    - parts of brain: diencephalon (info relay, homeostasis), brain stem (info relay, autonomic), cerebellum (coordination), cerebrum (conscious thought & memory) 
    - cerebrum: 
        - enlarged in primates: intellect, learning, memory, language, conciousness
        - divided into 2 hemispheres
        - 4 lobes:
            1. frontal: thinking, short-term memory, planning, movement
            2. parietal: interprets sensory info, spacial awareness
            3. occipital: processes images & stores them in memory
            4. temporal: various functions from reasoning to auditory perception
            - corpus callosum: axons that connect 2 hemispheres 
        - cerebral cortex: top layer (gray matter)
            - rich in cell bodies
            - grooves & ridges inc SA (turing pattern)
            - left side of cerebral cortex controls/communicates w/ right side of body & vice versa
    - limbic system:
        - incl. amygdala (emotional), hippocampus (memory), nucleus accumbens (reward & reinforcement, aversive behaviour)
        - responsible for basic physiological drives such as hunger, thirst, emotion, long-term memory
        - "pleasure & pain centres" located in limbic sys

intro video:
    - kibale forest national park, uganda
        - colobus monkey uses tree like pole vault to get around
            - colobus monkeys are leaf eaters (very hard to digest, they mostly just chill around not doing much)
    - female chimps will stay back to groom babies
        - will also rip branches to make day nest on the ground to chill in 
    - bwindi impenetrable national park
        - gorillas usually chill on the ground and eat grass & leaves
        - male silverback gorillas usually don't do much except when there is commotion where they'll do an agressive display
        - baboons are very curious and will tear everything apart (keep stuff away from them)
