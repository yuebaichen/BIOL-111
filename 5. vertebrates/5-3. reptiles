L22 - 5.3: verts 3 - reptiles: how to get away from land altogether?

reptila: fully terrestrial - 3 major mechanisms allowing reptiles to get away from land altogether (although some still spend most of time in water, come out of water to lay eggs)
    - have scales with hard keratin (protein that helps form hair, nails, & skins outer layer - epidermis)
    - not monophyletic, birds are nested within reptiles but we don't call birds reptiles
    1. more efficient heart:
        - reptiles with exception of crocodiles & birds have a partial septum in heart instead of full septum (left-right, right-left, or bidirectional)
            - similar shunts in septum in humans (from fetus stage) need to be corrected surgically (hole in septum is bad -> mixing of oxygenated & de-oxygenated blood)
        - have TWO AORTA!!!
        - reptiles who can spend lots of time underwater can shunt blood away from lungs and only pump through systemic circuit
    - reptiles breathe via lungs only
    - must conserve water:
        - scaly skin is waterproofed by B-"keratin"
        2. produce a special nitrogenous waste (uric acid)
    - reproduce & develop on land:
        - internal fertilization
        3. amniotic egg: egg surrounded by extra-embryonic layers
            - external shell:
                - leathery or brittle (calcium carbonate - CaCO3)
                - permeable to gases (O2 & CO2): cannot be submerged in water in order to still be permeable to gases
                - fairly impermeable to water: reason why reptiles can breed on land, shell locks moisture inside shell
                - not present in therian animals (viviparous: bring forth live young that have developed inside the body of parent, internal amniotic egg)
            - structure of egg:
                - albumen: provides water & mechanical support
                    - chorion: allows gas exchange
                        - amnion: contains embryo
                            - allantois: contains wastes
                            - yolk sac: contains nutrients
            - implications of terrestrial egg:
                - internal fertilization:
                    - sperm cannot penetrate egg shell so egg shell must be formed after internal fertilization
                    - shell & albumen are added to the fertilized egg in the female's oviduct (uterine/fallopian tubes)
                - storage of non-toxic nitrogen waste product is requred: uric acid in allantois
                - egg is so evolved to be on land that it can't be in water

excretory organs control volume, concentration, & composition of extracellular fluids & excretes wastes:
    - excretory products:
        - salts (like in marine iguanas, spending time in saltwater leads to excess salt buildup), ions
            - released by skin, gills, kidneys, specialized glands
        - water (vampire bats)
        - fecal matter released by digestive system
        - nitrogenous wastes: product of protein & DNA metabolism (DNA have tons of nitrogen), released by excretory organs (kidneys) as well as skin & gills depending on species
            - 3 forms of NITROGENOUS WASTES!!!:
                1. ammonia (NH3):
                    - water solubility: very
                    - toxicity: very (which is why fish kept in small containers will die especially if they've been recently fed)
                    - disposal: needs to be diluted & disposed quickly or converted to less toxic form (urea or uric acid)
                    - who?:
                        - ray-finned fish (marine & fresh)
                        - aquatic inverts (marine & fresh)
                        - larval amphibians
                2. urea:
                    - water solubility: medium
                    - toxicity: medium
                    - disposal: less water needed for disposal
                    - who?:
                        - cartilaginous fish
                        - most adult amphibians
                        - mammals
                3. uric acid:
                    - water solubility: insoluble (BIRD POOP)
                    - toxicity: not toxic
                    - disposal: little water needed for disposal
                    - who?: PERFECTS FOR AMNIOTIC EGG!!!
                        - insects
                        - reptiles
                        - birds
    - vertebrate excretory organ: kidney
        - function: regulate water & dissolved solute levels in blood ("filter the blood"), forms urine
        - process: blood -> glomerulus ("ball of yarn") -> forces anything thats not large into Bowman's capsule
            -> filtrate enters renal tubule -> specific ions, nutrients, water reabsorbed & returned to blood through peritubular capillaries
            -> additional substances secreted into filtrate for excretion -> final filtrate excreted
            - not a very efficient system since things are overabsorbed/excreted and need to be excreted/reabsorbed (HOWEVER, counter current exchange improves the efficiency)
        - blood is passed loads of times through kidney each day!!! 5L of blood in human body but our kidneys receive 2000L of blood/day (only 12% is filtered through Bowman's capsule)
        - example: vampire bats
            - all of their nutrition comes from blood: means high water and nitrogen content
            - kidneys immediately begin producing diluted urine from blood after feeding in order to shed excess weight to fly: approx 25% of blood volume excreted as urine in first hour
            - uring then becomes increasingly concentrated as bat works to eliminate rapid accumulation of urea without causing dehydration

non-avian reptiles: 4 major groups
    - general info:
        - ~6k species: mostly terrestrial
        - carnivores, herbivores, omnivores
        - dry skin, scales
        - first amniotes (produces amniotic egg): aroes during carboniferous ~300 Mya
    1. lepidosauria: squamates (incl. lizards & snakes) & tuataras (resemble lizards but w/ several diff characters - only two extant species)
        - all have skin covered w/ horny scales
        - gas exchange onlyl through lungs
        1-1. squamates: lizards, snakes, & stuff
            - lizards:
                - highly diverse
                - some have lost their legs (~32 seperate events): have evolved reduced legs when they went underground
                    - whole bunch of legless snake looking lizards without legs
                    - example of group that lost their legs: amphisbaenians - weird white tipped snake looking thing
                        - limb girdles & legs much reduced: no legs except in Bipes
                        - eyes are reduced (essentially blind), no ear opening
                        - scales fused into rings (annuli) encircling the body
                        - have really nasty teeth
                        - have shovel shaped head believed to aid in burrowing underground (spend almost entire lives underground)
                - komodo dragon gets to 3m long
                - marine iguana males stake out & fight for big territories to improve mating chance with females when they come up to bask
            - snakes:
                - no limbs
                - 200+ repeated vertebrae
                - highly kinetic skull: can dislocate jaws to swallow stuff much bigger than their head, can make head much bigger than body
                - vomeronasal organ (in other organisms too, paired auxillary olfactory (smell) sense organ in soft tissue of nasal septum just above roof of mouth)
                - example: ball pythons
                    - have mendelian genes that are very closely associated with colour morphs
        1-2. tuataras:
            - only ONE SPECIES exist in new zealand (endangered): common ancestor with lizards & snakes ~220 Mya
                - huge emphasis on conservation of tuataras: losing them means losing huge chunck of evolutionary history
            - no external ears
            - are nocturnal
            - well-developed parietal eye:
                - "third eye" on top of head for light sensing that guides circadian rhythm (& regulates hormone production & temp)
                - also found in other reptile groups but particularly well developed in tuataras
    3. testudinia: turtles & turtoises
        - have changed very little in past 250 mil years 
        - dorsal & ventral bony plates expand to form a shell (dorsal shell is an expansion of the ribs)
        - mostly aquatic (turtle), some terrestrial (tortoise) (sea turtles come ashore to lay eggs)
        - human exploitation has resulted in declining populations: all are now endangered
            - introduction of alien species to galapagos had huge negative impact on tortoises
            - sailors would collect tortoises and put them on their back on their ships so they had fresh meat to eat (can survive 6 months without food or water)
    4. crocodilia: crocodiles, caimans, gharials, alligators
        - spend lot of time in water (have shunt to block pulmonary circuit)
        - build nest on land or floating piles of vegetation
        - all are carnivorous
        - can reach massive sizes (3m)
        
intro vid:
    - amphisbaenian does this funny looking threat display to make it seem dangerous when it isn't (raises up both tail and head to confuse predator)
    - snakes are generally comfortable in the water (sea snakes spend all of their time underwater only coming out to lay eggs)
    - marine iguanas spend loads of time basking on black rocks for thermoregulation
        - snort salt out of their nostrils (salt glands)
        - walk via opposition (and are very flat to the ground)
        - undulates back leg and tail together like a snake (aliens 4 swimming motion was modelled after marine iguanas)
        - forage on algae on intertidal zone or underwater
    - lava lizards lift up their toes on hot surfaces, does pushups when they sense there is a rival (common display of many lizards)
    - sea turtles spend vast majority of time in sea where they do all their foraging, will eventually return to natal sites to dig nest for eggs
    - embryos in eggs have tissue layer called the chorion with vessels that pick up oxygen diffusing through shell
    - geckos have structure on their toes (microscopic setae/spatulae) that allow them to form molecular bonds (van der waals force) with any surface they touch (except teflon)
        - geckos are nocturnal
    - female ball pythons with eggs have deposits of uric acid showing up on scans from their eggs
