L24 - 5.5: verts 5 - mammals I: hair, milk, placenta

mammal intro:
    - ~5k species
    - each group has new evolutionary innovations but doesn't necessarily mean they inherently fit better into the world
        - all the aforementioned groups have are still extant and have been around evolutionarily much longer than humans
    - there is only an implied set of lineages of additional traits, not a progressive or designed path
    - formed from within reptiles to acquire lactation, fur, & sweat glands

3 unique features specific to mammals:
    1. hair: insulation, camouflage, sensory & defence, display
        - hair & feathers evolved independently: completely separate evolutionary solutions to insulation
        - hair for sensing in the dark, quills on porcupine
    2. sweat glands
    3. mammary glands: milk production (hence the name mammals)

4 other features of mammals:
    1. endothermic, 4-chambered heart
        - not completely homeothermic (body temp drops during hibernation)
    2. "advanced" nervous system
    3. internal fertilization
    4. unlike fish & reptiles, mammals show heterodonty (massive variation in teeth specialized for diff tasks)
        - specialized teeth among species reflects varied diets
        - example: beaver have molars for grinding wood but also have sharp incisors for shearing for cutting down trees
            - front of incisor is hard & back is soft so teeth can stay sharp as they eat: beavers wear down front teeth throughout lifetime
            - consequently have really long teeth embedded into jaw that grow out over lifetime
        - example: wolvering have sideways angled back teeth that, when combined with their massive jaw muscles, allow them to crush bone with ease (they like to break bone & eat the marrow)
        
placenta: also found in other animals such as marsupials and even fish (but it is a defining part of mammals)
    - organ formed by embryon & mother after implantation (start of embryo development, first stage of gestation)
        - formed by extraembryonic membranes (chorion, fetal part of placenta that connects to maternal part) & uterus lining of mother
        - site of gas, nutrient, & waste exchange between mother & embryo
        - produces hormones necessary to maintain pregnancy
        - amnion lined egg contains embryo & chorion is behind the amnion connected to the maternal part
    - basic function:
        - substances passes between mother & fetus via diffusion
        - 2 separate blood systems (RH +/- can cause antibodies to develop which can cause problems for succedent offspring)
        - no mixing of blood cells or plasma!!
    - very different circ patterns in fetus (shunts since blood comes from mother)
    - molecular movement across the placenta
        - small molecules move via diffusion 
            - O2 & CO2
            - fetal hemoglobion has higher oxygen affinity (strength of pull on valence electrons and attraction in binding) than adult hemoglobin
                - thus, oxygen moves to fetus
            - urea
            - nutrients (sugars, vitamins, minerals)
            - hormones
            - also: alcohol & drugs (caffeine, coccaine, etc)

divergence of reptillian & mammalian-like amniotes: carboniferous (~350 Mya)
    - skull morphology: number of temporal fenestrae (holes) is the key characteristic used to identify relatedness among amniotes
        - hole used for muscle attachment of jaw muscles
    - anapsids (turtles): no temporal fenestrae
    - synapsids (therapsids & mammals): one big below middle
    - eurapsids (extinct marine reptiles): one small above middle
    - diapsids (dinos & birds): two one above the other

mammal evolution:
    - general:
        - true mammals evolved ~225 Mya (Triassic period)
            - early mammals were small, arboreal (living in trees), shrew-like insectivores, nocturnal
            - "improvements" to middle ear (middle ear bones, hammers and stuff)
                - evolved from bones in jaw which were derived from gill arches
                - occured twice: once in monotremes, another in eutherians
            - example: hadrocodium wui
                - ~195 Mya (jurrasic)
                - found in china
                - size: 32mm, 2g 
                - significantly larger brain for its size
                - has middle ear derived from jaw bone
    - mammals did not radiate until extinction of the "dinos": coexisted w/ dinos (were not wusses after all)
        - became dominant upon "saur" extinction ~65 Mya
            - thought that dinos chased around mammals & mammals hid when asteriod struck
            - however mammals were pretty cool even before dinos went extinct:
                - squirrel-like gliders
                - badger-like critters eating dino eggs & babies
                - evolution of sucking & swallowing 
        - diversified & filled empty terrestrial & marine niches (large herbivores & carnivores)
        - returned to oceans
    - evolution back to sea: whales!!
        - re-evolved many features to make them more efficient in water so they can reinvade water >:D
        - multiple separate origins of extant marine mammals
            - orcas & dolphins close to cows
            - walruses close to dogs
            - mantees close to elephants
        - ambulocetus: ancestor or close cousin to whales (2 similar traits)
            - ~50 Mya
            - ~3m long (mammalian equivalent of crocodile)
            1. ear similar to whales, can hear well underwater
            2. similar teeth to cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises)
    - age of mammals: cenozoic (66 Mya - now)
        - used to be much more magnificant/large mammals 15-20k years ago
            - huge bears, ancient bison, mammoths, lions, camels, giant beaver
            - tar pits in LA create huge bone deposits of such animals (trapped animals)
        - example: megatherium (giant ground sloth)
            - ~2 Mya - 8k years ago
            - herbivorous, elephant-sized, & dug huge holes in the ground
        - example: smilodon (saber-toothed cat/tiger, not actually a tiger but it is a cat)
            - 1.5 Mya -> 11k years ago (pleistocene epoch, ice age)
            - contemporary (occuring at same time) w/ humans, mammoths, giant ground sloths
        - example: dire wolves
            - powerful canines w/ lots and lots of fossils in record
        - 2 possible reasons why the pleistocene mammals/megafauna (megatherium, smilodon, etc) went extinct:
            1. hunting by humans (or climate + human-caused fires)
                - fossils of mammoths & stuff stabbed w/ big spear points
                - evidence shows locations of fires correlated with location of extinctios
                    - climate dried env + human setting fires -> extinction (disappearance of megafauna (large/giant animals) coincided with major fire episodes)
                    - fires have massive effects on shaping terrestrial ecosystems & humans historically have hugely modified env in NA by burning
                    - however fires weren't everywhere so it can't be the sole explanation (however, it matches to the events in LA)
            2. climate change (end of ice age)

3 mammal groups:
    1. prototherians (monotremes): egg laying (don't give birth to living young)
        - fertilize internally then lay shelled eggs (oviparous)
            - females lack placenta (organ provides oxygen & nutrients to growing baby)
            - incubated by parents until hatching
        - have mammary glands (can produce milk): however they have no nipples, young suck milk from fur
        - example: platypus (eastern australia)
            - use bill to dig for crustaceans & worms
            - build nests in river banks
            - lay 2-4 eggs which hatch in ~8 days
            - males have venomous "spurs" on hind legs (hook like things connected to venom glands near pelvis, also used to keep females from retracting during copulation)
                - ARE THE ONLY VENEMOUS MAMMALS!!!
                    - venemous vs poisonous vs toxic:
                        - venemous: toxin is injected in you
                        - poisonous: you injest the toxin
                        - toxic: refers to the venom or poison itself
            - carries stuff to its den by curling it in its tail
        - example: echidna (new guinea, island of australia)
            - short & long nose species (spiny ant-eaters)
            - insectivores w/ sticky tongue
            - temporary pouch for egg
                - hatch (~8 days), spines (sharp quill things) form while in pouch (~3 weeks)
            - fully terrestrial & can live for ~50 years
            - they "pancake" onto puddle on hot days to cool down
    - therians:
        2. marsupials: pouched
            - ~350 species: kangaroos, koalas, opossums (one species in NA (OPOSSUMS!!), a few in SA, mostly in AUS)
                - usually went extinct in places where mammals continued to evolve
            - early birth, fetus completes development in pouch
            - do not lay eggs: viviparous w/ placenta
            - short gestation period (period inside womb), long nursing period
            - birth after short internal development
            - NEWBORNS CRAWL OVER MOTHER'S BODY to pouch: attach/bite/suck to nipple in pouch to complete development (nutrition of mother's milk changes to match developmental stage of newborn)
            - example: tasmanian devil
                - extinct on mainland due to hunting & dingos (ancient lineage of dog in australia)
                - largest extant marsupial carnivore (size of small dog, only found in tasmania)
                - scavengers
            - example: tasmanian tiger/wolf (thylacine)
                - are unfortunately now extinct
                - looked like wolve/coyotes/dog, however are not at all related to any of them (diverged ~100 Mya)
            - example: opossum
                - only marsupial species in NA
                - will play dead if bothered or harassed
            - marsupial evolution:  
                - diverged from early placentals ~100 Mya
                - most NA marsupials are extinct
                - convergent evolution between placental mammals & australian marsupials:
                    - parallel radiation of similar forms w/ a completely separate evolutionary lineage
        3. eutherian ("true therians"): placental
            - 94% of mammal species
            - viviparous (give birth to live young): have no pouch or shelled egg
            - amniotic egg (embryo) retained in female reproductive tract for longer: embryo nourished by mother via placenta
                - give birth to relatively well developed young
            - often referred to as placental animals, however some marsupials also have placenta
            - rodents are the most speciose mammal group (~2k species)

intro video:
    - its a wonder how small mammals like mice, voles, shrew can survive cold winters given small size 
    - beavers dam creeks: really important in structuring env (change nutrient dynamics of soil/streams, hydrological flow patterns, create habitats, kill lowlying trees)
        - beavers chop down trees to build dams but also to nibble/eat the living bark of trees
    - lots of animals rely heavily on smell (lots of animals leave olfactory traces on little piece of conifer/hemlock)
    - bears will repeatedly rub on particular trees - will scratch off bark to induce sap secretion which helps remove excess fur
    - different animals have to decide which path is the easiest to navigate - moose can break ankles trying to walk around
