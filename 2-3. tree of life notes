L6 - tree of life

history of the tree of life
- taxonomy: tree as a classification scheme
    - Aristotles’s Scala nature, 400BC
    - Linnaeus’ Systemae Naturae, 1735
    - species are immutable
- phylogeny: trees as a depiction of evolution
    - Lamarack, 1809: adaptations are acquired
    - Darwin, 1837: adaptations via natural selection
    - Darwin, 1859 (On the Origin of Species)
- big surprises from molecular phylogenetics:
    - new Domain of Life
    - extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
- history of molecular phylogenetics:
    - Watson & Crick, 1953: “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material”
    - Crick, 1958: suggests the idea of protein taxonomy
    - Pauling & Zuckerlandl, 1964:
        - Molecular Clock
        - based on hemoglobin protein sequences
- bacteria are notoriously hard to classify
    - Linnaeus, 1774: “chaos”
    - Haeckel, 1866: Monera at the base of the tree giving rise to more complex forms
    - Chatton, 1937: Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes
- morphology, metabolism has limited information
- molecular phylogeny provides the perfect tool
- which molecule (gene) to use? (align->infer tree)
    - hemoglobin
    - ribosomal RNA
    - DNA helices
    - ATP synthase
- Woese: “not elegant science, but a big slog”
    - requires culturing large amounts of bacteria
    - extract RNA, fragment, run on a gel to produce a “fingerprint”
        - one day, Woese’s lab fingerprints a methanogen to see where it would fall within the prokaryotes
        - bacteria & archaea had been grouped together due to morphological similarities
    - Woese continues to add branches to the tree
    - halophilic and thermoacidophilic bacteria also turn out to be archaea
        - halophilic: extremophile that thrives in high salt concentrations
            - extremophile: organism that is able to live/thrive in extreme environments
        - thermoacidophlic: extremophile that that is both thermophilic and acidophilic; grow under high temp and low pH
    - distinctness of arches also supported by weird phospholipids
- refining the tree (with more data):
    - correction: ester -> ether
    - correction: reversion (not parsimonious
- are we basically archaea? if so, which ones?:

the three-domain three of life
- origin
    - bacteria: domain of unicellular organism that has a cell wall but lack organelle and an organized nucleus (prokaryote)
        - prokaryote: “before nucleus” - no nucleus
    - split
        - eukarya: domain of organisms that have cells with a nucleus and other organelles (eukaryotic)
        - archaea: domain of unicellular prokaryotic organisms initially classified as bacteria but later reclassified due to distinct differences from bacteria:
            - cell wall does not contain peptidoglycan
            - cell membrane uses ether linked lipids as opposed to ester linked
            - cannot perform photosynthesis
            - have distinct metabolic pathways and genes
- prokaryotes are not a domain since they are not monophyletic
    - monophyly: shares common ancestor that excludes other groups
        - monophyletic: group of a clade
        - clade: group consisting of an organism and all its descendants
        - paraphyletic: group of organisms that contain a common ancestor and some but not all of the descendants OR doesn’t include other branch at common ancestor (does not meet cladistic criterion/test)
        - polyphyletic: group that contains clades from multiple separate branches of the tree of life, not forming a complete clade (does not meet cladistic criterion/test)

phylogenetics
- methods:
    - start with a sequence alignment
    - identify changes at homologous sites
    - choose a method:
        - distance-based: compute a distance matrix between each pair of sequences; join the two most similar sequences & repeat
        - parsimony: choose the tree structure that minimizes the total number of mutations
- molecular clock example: coronavirus
    - SARS-CoV-2 point mutations appear once every ~2 weeks
        - this allows us to fit a molecular clock ad build “time trees”
- how to read a tree:
    - phylogenies are like mobiles; branches can rotate but it doesn’t change the meaning
    - read distance to the last common ancestor


LUCA
- all cells today descended from a single cell that lived in the ocean long ago called LUCA (last universal common ancestor)
    - all the other cells alive then gave rise to lineages which subsequently became extinct and have left no descendants
    - LUCA divided to give rise to two daughter cells:
        - one was the ancestor of all living eubacteria
        - the other was the ancestor of all living archaea
- portrait of LUCA:
