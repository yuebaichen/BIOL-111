L12 - 3.5: plants 4 - trees & seeds (gymnosperms)

intro:
    - almost all worlds most dominant ecosystems consist in large part of trees/grasses (grasses are flowering plants)
    - gymnosperms mostly dominate the north whereas trees near the equator are angiosperms
    - seed plants include both gymnosperms & angiosperms except angiosperms have additional innovation of flowers
    - gymnosperms dominate earth's surface between 359 Mya to 145 Mya

timeline of plant height: plants got big with the rise of trees:
    - Silurian: mosses (cm)
    - Devonian: gilboa trees (20 m)
    - Carboniferous: fern trees (30-50 m)
    - Cretaceous: conifer trees
    - Today: conifer trees (100+ m, 650 tons) (some of the biggest plants to ever exist on earth)

what is a tree?:
    - simple definition: a growth form where a plant with single stem & branching canopy can reach large heights thanks to specialized cells
    - stricter definition: has wood & increases in girth
        - excludes early tree-like plants (Gilboa trees)
        - excludes modern "trees" (palms, banana trees, fern trees)

rise of trees:
    - key innovation of seed plants: ability to grow wood & ability to grow as trees
    - trees ARE NOT a single taxonomic group!: trees are a growth form that exist in many branches of the seed plants
        - not all seed plants are trees, but all trees are seed plants
        - from a tree-ish ancestor, many lineages later evolved to be herbaceous (single growing season, has herbs/buds)

from ancient (fern-like) trees to gymnosperms:
    - archaeopteris: extinct genus of fern-like trees
        - considered the first "true tree"
        - wood similar to modern gymnosperm wood
        - trunks (30 m) with reinforced branch joints
        - fern-like leaves
        - still reproduced via spores, but had 2 types of spores (heterospory)

3 key innovations of gymnosperms:
    1. wood:
        - modern trees have vascular cambium: ring layer of dividing cells beneath the bark
        - produces & lays down new layer of xylem (lignified) & phloem tissue every year (tree rings)
        - live & dead xylem accumulates to form wood (composite of cellulose fibres in lignin matrix)
        - allows trees to build support (via girth) as they build height
        - wood ecology:
            - emerald ash borer larvae eat the phloem & young xylem of ash trees
            - this kills the ash trees since the roots don't photosynthesize & require the fixed carbon (sugars) from the leaves to be transported through the phloem in order to survive
    2. reproduction: (innovations from ferns)
        - pollen: no more spores (encased gametes that replace motile sperm)
            - previous male gametes (akin to sperm) had to swim through environment to female gamete to fertilize (requires water for fertilization)
            - spores evolved into pollen grains:
                - tiny male gametophyte (2-3) encased in tough coat
                    - pollen coat is incredibly durable: one of most recalcitrant compounds known to humans (can be preserved for hundreds of thousands of years)
                - germinates to form pollen tube
                - sperm swims down pollen tube to ovule
            - pollen grains allowed efficient reproduction in dry habitats (ability to grow in dry habitats)
                - can be exposed to air for long periods without drying out
                - carried to female gametophyte by wind/animals
        - seeds: no more second free-living generation (fertilized embryo protected in seed)
            - fertilized ovule forms seeds! (embryo contained within seed)
            - outer tissue becomes protective seed coat
            - seed growth is provisioned by mother plant (but no fruit!)
            - dispersal (conifer example): cones open when seeds are mature to release for dispersal
    3. heterospory:
        - homospory: spores all same size (bryophtes, ferns)
        - heterospory: spores are of two sizes (seed plants)
            - small ones (microspores) form pollen grain (male)
            - big ones (megaspores) form ovule with egg, housed in cones in case of conifers (female)
        - advantages of heterospory:
            - not exposed to air
            - dessication resistant
            - male gametophyte has to "burrow" to access female gametophyte 

spores vs seeds:
    - spores:
        - definition: unicellular microscopic reproductive structure that can develop into a new individual
        - occurence: non-flowering plants & fungi
        - size: microscopic
        - cellularity: unicellular
        - production: produced in large numbers
        - ploidy: haploid
        - food storage: does not store food
        - survival: susceptible to harsh environmental conditions
    - seeds: (pollen grains are technically multicellular)
        - definition: fertilized ovule of seed plants
        - occurence: gymnosperms & angiosperms
        - size: macroscopic
        - cellularity: multicellar
        - production: produced in small numbers
        - ploidy: diploids
        - food storage: stores food
        - survival: can tolerate harsh environmental conditions

gymnosperm life cycle (conifer):
    - mature sporophyte:
        - cones with sporangia:
            - meiosis -> haploid microspore forms pollen grain
            - mitosis -> multicellular pollen grain
            - pollination -> disperal by wind
        - ovulate cone:
            - contain ovules
            - ovules contain megasporangia
            - megasporangium contains diploid mother cell
            - meiosis -> 4 products, one is large & forms the megaspore, the rest die
    - pollen grain burrows to ovule:
        - megaspore divides to form female gametophyte
        - mitosis -> female gametophyte forms eggs
        - pollen tube delivers sperm to egg
        - only one egg is fertilized
        - fertilization mitosis: forms diploid embryo within seeds
        - seeds dispersed by wind/animals
        - germination: developing sporophyte

gymnosperms: facts
    - means "naked seed": unfertilized seed (ovules) are open to the air to be directly pollinated (no ovary)
    - include all modern seed-bearing plants that don't have flowers or ovaries
    - includes conifers (pines, redwoods, cypress), cycads, ginkgos, gnetophytes
    - a lot of gymnosperm species have gone extinct since they first evolved
    - produce seeds but do not produce fruit
    - age of gymnosperms (299-145 Mya)
        - includes jurassic period
        - later outcompeted by angiosperms
    - records:
        - tallest living organism: redwood species named Hyperion (115 m)
        - largest living "non-clonal" organism: giant sequoia (1487 m3, bigger than blue whale)
        - oldest living "non-clonal" organism: bristle cone pine (5k years old)
    
gymnosperms today:
    - cycads:
        - not palms!: more closely related to pine trees
        - ~100 extant species left of once large tropical group
        - slow growing & long lived (up to 1k year old)
        - ex of evolutionary stasis: cycads were once large part of diet of some herbivorous dinosaurs
        - separate male & female plants: cones either produce pollen (males) or ovules (females)
        - descended from one of first groups that branched off from ferns and still have motile sperm (like non-vascular plants)
    - ginkgo biloba:
        - closest living relative are cycads! (big weirdos, equivalent to humans and snakes)
            - share more ancient features with cycads:
                - motile sperm
                - male & female plants
        - "living fossil" - visibly related to prehistoric fossils
        - only 1 extant species (wild but endangered in China, but grown globally)
        - all relatives (from same order) are extinct!: have been alone for over 3 million years
        - have big weird looking seeds
        - have weird leaves with parallel veins
        - can live for at least 1400 years
    - conifers (cone-bearers): most abundant/dominant gymnosperms on earth today
        - most diverse group of extant gymnosperms (~630 species)
        - all conifer trees are woody & cone-bearing, most are trees
        - includes pines, cypress, yews, larches
        - dominate the worlds largest forest biome: boreal forest (taiga, characterized by coniferous forests)
        - pines:
            - pines specialize in dry environments (both hot & cold)
            - challenges of winter:
                - resistance to cold: thick bark, pine cones sheltering the seeds
                - ability to shed snow: cone shaped tree, down-facing flexible branches
                - wind resistance: dense wood & waxy needles
            - pines in warm climates:
                - resistance to dryness: thin needles to aid thermoregulation
    - climate change & range:
        - vegetation greeness change over last 20 years:
            - inc heat & drought stress -> death along southern margin of taiga -> browning of southern taiga
            - trees & shurbs expand north into tundra as climate warms -> greening of northern taiga
        - albedo change in tundra over last 20 years (light reflectivity)
            - lower albedo in the north due to inc vegetation coverage -> more warming
            - albedo is a factor that controls earth temp: light not reflected warms the surface!
            - forest covered tundra accelerates arctic warming (conifers shed snow)
            - positive reinforcement cycle: more greening of tundra -> more warming -> more greening of tundra

trees today: trees & humans (all trees as a growth form)
    - montreal is often 10 deg C hotter than surrounding land
    - urban heat island effect
        - dark materials absorb more heat (concrete, asphalt)
        - "canyons" created by tall buildings along roads trap heat
        - lack of plant cover (esp trees) lead to lower albedo
    - climate change will inc extreme heat in cities
    - more trees/greenspace -> cooler surface temp
    - cooling from trees:
        - trees provide shade (higher albedo than concrete/asphalt)
        - plants shed heat via evaporative cooling: trees are constantly losing water from their stomata
        - temp diff under canopy can create breeze
        - total cooling effect of 3-9 deg C
        - non linear relationship of more trees -> cooler surface temp in urban environments 
            - has to pass certain threshold where trees start to have progressively strong effect on local temp (~40% tree cover)
