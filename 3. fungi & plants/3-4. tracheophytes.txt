L11 - 3.4: plants 3 - vascular plants (tracheophytes)

first vascular plants: ancestors to modern day ferns & fern allies (close relative) - silurian-devonian explosion & carboniferous periods

early silurian landscape: small bryophyte-like things & GIANT FUNGI
    - non-vascular plants colonize land:
        - advantages:
            - huge uncolonized area
            - abundant light
            - abundant CO2
            - less herbivory
        - challenges:
            - uv radiation (anthocyanins)
            - dehydration (cuticle)
            - dispersal (hardy spores, reproductive structures)
            - gravity
            - nutrients
        - new challenges:
            - competition (for space, light, water, nutrients)
            - colonize drier environments
            - grow taller
            - grow deeper

mid silurian landscape: BRANCHES
    - key innovations:
        - complexity/competition: branching
            - profound adaptation that fundamentally changed plants
            - earliest plants could not branch (or grow very tall)
            - earliest plants: green stems with no leaves
            - branching enabled different stems to specialize:
                - roots: grow along ground to acquire nutrients
                - stems: grow up to outcompete neighbours for light (shade out competitors)
            - plants are inherently modular organisms: important feature of plants that differentiates from animals
        - drier environments: stomata
            - cuticle reduces water loss but also limits gas exchange
            - stoma: opening/pore surrounded by specialized guard cells:
                - guard cells let plant control stomata opening
                - stomata allows gas exchnge (open) & prevents water loss (closed)
            - stomata are on bottom of leaf since less evaporation
            - cuticle & stomata evolved together: stomata enabled evolution of full cuticle
        - taller: vascular tissue
            - vascular tissue: specialized reinforced conductive tissue
            - 2 functions: transport (water, sugars, nutrients) & support
            - extant non-vasular plants have conducting cells have no secondary thickening: some conductance but no support (sponges)
            - earliest vascular plants:
                - thickened conducting cells
                - some branches but no leaves or roots (used photosynthetic stems)
                - increasingly effective vascular tissue: from spongy cork-like tissue to hollow lignified tubes
            - increasing differentiation over time: tissues become more specialized over time -> more structural support (evolution of water-conducting cells, xylem)
                - bryophtes:
                    - structural features:
                        - primary wall (with cellulose)
                    - simple water conducting cells:
                        - elongated cells with little structural support
                        - found in fossils & present-day mosses
                - earliest vascular plants:
                    - structural features:
                        - primary wall (with cellulose)
                        - lignin (deposited as rings)
                            - lignin appears in cell walls for the FIRST TIME!!: allows plants to get big
                    - first vascular tissue:
                        - some structural support
                        - found in fossils
                - ferns & most gymnosperms:
                    - structural features:
                        - primary wall (with cellulose)
                        - secondary wall (with lignin)
                        - ends & sides have pits where secondary wall is absent
                    - tracheids:
                        - increased structural support
                        - found in all vascular plants
                - flowering plants:
                    - structural features:
                        - primary wall (with cellulose)
                        - secondary wall (with lignin)
                        - ends have perforations where both primary & secondary walls are absent
                    - vessel elements:
                        - found in gnetophytes & angiosperms
        - deeper: roots
            - 2 main functions: nutrient/water acquisition & physical support
            - 3rd function: interface with symbionts - mycorrhizal fungi symbionts present even in simplest root systems (e.g. ferns)
            - allow increased expansion into drier environments: plants could now go deeper to where water is instead of relying on osmosis/diffusion
            - multiple independent evolutions through Devonian 
            - responsible for creation of soil: breakdown aggregates/minerals, release acids, put organic matter into soil

devonian: age of forests
    - early Devonian: tallest plants ~1m (dwarfed by fungi!)
    - mid Devonian: shurblike forests of ferns & horsetails
        - competition for water/nutrients & need for support -> roots
        - competition for light -> flattened stems -> leaves
    - late Devonian: world's first forests, first tree-like plants
        - gilboa trees: look like modern fern trees
        - 8m tall (like modern palm tree) while rest of vegetation was only 2m
        - from ancient & weird fern-like family
        - no leaves present: increasingly fine branches
        - vascular tissue allowed for taller growth but no true wood (like modern ferns)

reduction of gametophyte: one of strongest trends in land plant evolution
    - bryophytes:
        - small, short-lived sporophyte
        - depends on gametophyte for nutrition
        - gametophyte-dominant life cycle
        - mostly in haploid form
    - vascular seedless plants:
        - sporophyte is much larger & longer lived than gametophyte
        - sporophyte-dominant life cycle
    - seed plants:
        - gametophytes are microscopic
    - advantages of sporophyte/diploid
        - twice as much DNA: increases potential expression of traits
        - diploid cells can respond to varying environmental conditions more efficiently
        - can mask deleterious mutations if individual is heterozygous (two different alleles) at many genes

extant vascular seedless plants: tracheophytes
    - lineage that first developed in Silurian & Devonian exist as modern day ferns & fern allies
    - ferns, horsetails, clubmosses (not actual mosses)
    - have vascular tissue (reinforced specialized tissue to conduct water/nutrients, but not true wood)
    - complex leaves & roots
    - sporophyte-dominant life cycle
    - disperse via spores (not seeds)

the sporophyte-dominant life cycle: sporophyte is large & long lived but still depends on gametophyte for nutrition when young
    - mature sporophyte undergoes meiosis (under fern leaves)
    - spores dispersed by wind undergo mitosis
    - spores develop into mature male & female gametophytes (small flat leaves)
    - sperm from antheridia swim to egg in archegonia (still requires water but much smaller than before)
    - sperm & egg undergo fertilization to form diploid zygote
    - zygote undergo mitotsis to develop into mature sporophyte

fern evolution
    - once dominant on earth but later overtaken by seed plants
    - 11k extant species (2nd only to angiosperms): mostly found in tropics
    - lot of species remain very similar to how they were when they first evolved ("evolutionary stasis")
        - e.g. Osmunda claytoniana unchanged for at least 180 million years (even fossilized nuclei & chromosomes)
    - hybridization: most eukaryotes have some hybridization between close relatives
        - many species of ferns hybridize in nature
        - hybridization thought to have played major role in fern evolution (often between very disparate parents, e.g. 60 million years apart)

ferns today
    - roots very similar to leaves
    - leaves produce spores -> sporophyte
    - widespread & still dominant in some ecosystems (e.g. New Zealand, ferns trees 20m)
    - make up a lot of diversity in tropical forest canopy
    - invasive ferns
    - 25-30% of ferns are epiphytes (live on other plants)
        - host huge diversity of invertebrates (insects & arthropod)
    - bioremediation of heavy metals:
        - ferns are really good at taking up heavy metals in soil
        - heavy metal contamination in soil is very common after mining
        - ferns can bioaccumulate metals in their leaves (then harvest & remove)
        - slow process but cheap
        - how some ferns can tolerate lethal levels of heavy metals:
            - proteins that help bind it, move it, & induce stress responses
            - stored in vacuole in less toxic form

environmental varitation that plants face
    - environment:
        - light & uv
        - water (drought, flood)
        - temperature (high, low)
        - ice, fire, wind, acidity
    - materials:
        - nutrient availability
        - salt
        - metals
    - predation:
        - herbivores
        - pathogens
