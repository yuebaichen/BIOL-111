L9 - 3.2: plants 1 - marine algae & photosynthesis {6}

1. note about taxonomy & human bias {4}:
    -1) trying to organize messy world of biology according to specific rules/constructs
    -2) our approach to organizing has shaped our view of the branches of life
    -3) Carl Linaeus (first person to pioneer latin binomial naming) creates his first classification system for nature with three kingdoms: animals, vegetables, & minerals (rocks!)
    -4) we evolved our understanding of life on earth fairly rapidly {3}:
        --1) 1969 (3 major kingdoms): consider plants&animals as separate but also adds fungi, other eukaryotes, & monera (microbes)
        --2) 2005 (5 major kingdoms): eukaryotes include more big branches of species
        --3) today: believed that there is 7-11 lineages of eukaryotes on earth (archaeplastids/"plantae" still group out together)

2. phylogeny of photosynthesis {3}:
    -1) photosynthesizers are NOT monophyletic: photosynthesis actually happens all over the eukaryotic kingdom (not just specific to plants)
        -ex1-5. cyanobacteria, photosynthetic amoeba, brown algae, diatoms (microalgae), dinoflagellates (plankton)
    -2) #^photosynthesis: process that converts light energy to chemical energy; "fixes" inorganic carbon into organic form & produces oxygen^#
    -3) fun fact {2}: not all plants photosynthesize (ex. parasitic plant "ghost pipe", steals carbon from fungi or another plant)
        --1) something to consider when classifying species based on characteristics is that traits can be lost (evolutionary explanation for some plants not being able to synthesize)
        --2) if most of a group of species has a certain trait, & evidence suggests that their common ancestor also had the trait, then the trait was probably lost

3. origin of photosynthesis {6}:
    -1) undisputed that photosynthesis evolved at least once in cyanobacteria
    -2) first evolved oxygenic photosynthesis (2.5-3 Bya)
    -3) laid foundation for all complex life today; planet was fundamentally transformed
    -4) developed multicellularity & cell specialization (2.2-2.5 Bya) (formed stromatolite lumps)
    -5) wave of abundance of cyanobacteria produced so much oxygen that it caused the Great Oxidation/Oxygenation Event {0, 0, 1}
        --*) 1st mass extinction event (oxygen was toxic to a lot of organisms back then), but made complex life possible
    -6) first photosynthetic eukaryotes (ancestors of modern plants) evolved ~1 billion years after cyanobacteria 

4. how did photosynthesis spread through the tree of life? {4}:
    (1-> hypotheses {2}:
        -1) hypothesis 1: eukaryotes evolved photosynthesis on their own later
        -2) hypothesis 2: eukaryotes gained/stole it from bacteria
    (2-> clues {2}:
        -1) clue 1: photosynthesis requires two photosystems (PSI&PSII) which both evolved in bacteria (having 2 photosystems evolve more than once is unlikely)
        -2) clue 2: all photosynthetic eukaryotes use similar structure (chloroplasts) for photosynthesis
    (3-> capture of photosynthesis (chloroplasts): endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts
        ((1-> hypothesis: heterotrophic eukaryote engulfed/invaginated a free living prokaryote (cyanobacteria) via endosymbiosis
        ((2-> suggested that the missing 3rd membrane is the eukaryotic membrane due to the double membrane of chloroplasts both containing peptidoglycan
        ((3-> similar to mitochondria: which came first? {2}:
            -1) almost all eukaryotes have mitochondria (except for one type of gut microbe in chinchilla)
            -2) suggests that mitochondria came first
        ((4-> evidence to support endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts {3}:
            -1) chloroplasts similar to cyanobacteria & behave somewhat independently of the cell {4}:
                --1) replicate by fission, independently of cell division
                --2) manufacture some of their own proteins
                --3) have their own DNA, organized into circular molecule very similar to those in some cyanobacteria (makes chloroplasts very difficult to genetically engineer)
                --4) peptidoglycan in cell wall of some chloroplasts
            -2) chloroplasts have (at least) a double membrane
            -3) endosymbiotic cyanobacteria live in cells of some eukaryotes&animals to this day (sea slugs, leaf slug, some amoeba)
    (4-> how did chloroplasts spread to most eukaryote "supergroups"? {2}:
        -1) clue: all species in plantae have chloroplasts with double membranes where chloroplasts in all other lineages have 2+ membranes
        -2) hypothesis {3}: endosymbiosis leading to chloroplasts first happen in common ancestor of plantae, then other groups acquired chloroplasts via secondary endosymbiosis
            --1) photosynthetic eukaryote is engulfed
            --2) nucleus from photosynthetic eukaryote is lost
            --3) chloroplast has 4 membranes organelle

5. photosynthesis today {3}: 
    (1-> phytoplankton {4}:
        ((1-> single-celled, free-living photosynthetic organisms (plants!)
        ((2-> responsible for ~50% of global photosynthesis
        ((3-> base of (almost) every ocean food web
        ((4-> phytoplankton consists of {2}:
            -1) photosynthetic bacteria {2}:
                --1) including cyanobacteria "blue-green algae"
                --2) responsible for half the oceans' primary productivity
            -2) single celled photosynthetic eukaryotes {1}:
                --1) mostly dinoflagellates & diatoms ("algae in glass houses")
    (2-> brown algae (phaeophytes) {9}: kelp
        -1) not plants! (looks like leaf like structures but not plants, ex. of convergent evolution)
        -2) 1500-2000 species
        -3) multicellular marine organisms
        -4) brownish colour from carotenoid pigment used in photosynthesis (carotenoid comes up all over biology: UV protection, coloration via carotenoid consumption)
        -5) individual thallus (no complex vascular system like plants)
        -6) diverse reproduction: sexual & asexual; can be multicellular in both haploid&diploid life stages
        -7) acquired photosynthesis via secondary endosymbiosis; chloroplasts with 4 membranes
        -8) kelp are incredibly productive (tallest kelp is 80m & can grow 3m/week); support particularly coast primary productivity 
        -9) kelp forests {2}:
            --1) kelp forests are the largest biogenic marine habitats (support incredible level of biodiversity; vertebrates, invertebrates, fish nurseries)
            --2) kelp forests are keystone species & can cause trophic cascades (primary producers forms basis of food chain since they are where energy enters the ecosystem) {3}
                ---1) kelp are an important source for food&habitat
                ---2) kelp are fed upon by sea urchins which are fed upon by otters
                ---3) removal of otters -> explosion in abundance of sea urchins, kelp massacre (near extinction of kelp beds)
    (3-> red algae {5}:
        ((1-> plants! (but not green)
        ((2-> most diverse marine seaweeds (7k+ species, contain coral forming species) {1}
            -ex. coralline red algae {4}:
                --1) plays important role in formation of structure that support reefs
                --2) secrete/lay down (hard) calcareous deposits in wall around cell that form large coralline structures (structures are left behind when cells die)
                --3) help build coral reefs {3}:
                    ---1) attract coral larvae
                    ---2) very dynamic: can patch up broken coral like a bandaid
                    ---3) reinforce coral skeletons
                --4) usually slow-growing; vulnerable to damage/exploitation (ex. coral harvesting in Mediterranean)
        ((3-> contain both unicellular & multicellular species
        ((4-> diverse reproduction: sexual & asexual
        ((5-> can live at great depths {2}:
            -1) red colour from photosynthetic carotenoid pigment
            -2) absorbs blue light which penetrates water deeper than any other visible wavelength (which is why water is blue)

6. algae & humans {7}: algae are important for a variety of human uses (other than supporting life on earth)
    -1) food: red algae
    -2) thickener: soups, toothpaste, ice cream, yogurt (carrageenan, compound isolated from algae)
    -3) agar (compound isolated from algae) media
    -4) gelatin substitute
    -5) packaging: bioplastics
    -6) potential sustainable fertilizer (cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere)
    -7) potential biofuel (single-celled simple organisms that can be grown in mass)
