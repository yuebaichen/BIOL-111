L13 - 3.6: plants 4 - angiosperms: flowers & fruit

intro to angiosperms:
    - most recently evolved group of plants
    - 300k species of angiosperms
    - existed from end of gymnosperm dominant period to present day (200 Mya to present)

the angiosperm radiation:
    - adaptive radiation: when one lineage produces an unusually large number of descendent species adapted to many habitats & ecological niches
        - big explosion of number of species
        - typically associated with some adaptation that allows for expansion into new ecological niches & habitats
    - angiosperms are one of the great adaptive radiations in history of life
    - unsure when angiosperms first started to evolve, but once they did, they took off very rapidly
    - 125-80 Mya (Cretaceous period):
        - life becomes more diverse on land than ocean for first time
        - angiosperm component of world's flora goes from ~0% to >75%
    - associated with 3 key innovations of angiosperms: enable angiosperms to transport water, pollen, & seeds efficiently 
        - more efficient xylem (go to plants 3 notes)
        - flowers
        - fruits
    - flowers are most associated with speciation (since they are the reproductive structures)
    - cause of rapid speciation in angiosperms:
        - reproductive isolation: diverging species no longer interbred, no gene mixing (last & often hardest step in speciation)
        - flowers are directly involved in mating & mate choice (changes in flowers -> changes in gene mixing -> formation of new species)
        - divergence in flowers can more quickly lead to reproductive isolation 
        - flower structures (carpel, stamen, petals) diversified -> fantastic array of sizes, shapes, & colours

what is a flower?:
    - basically a protected ovule housed on the flower
    - flowers are for plant sex, esp for finding mates
    - important anatomy:
        - presence of ovarian tissue (-> ovule)
        - stamen (male structure): anther, filament
        - carpel (female structure): stigma, style, ovary
    - contain reproductive organs: carpel, stamen, or both:
        - ovules develop in ovary
        - pollen grains develop in anther
    - may or may not be coupled with male & female structures together
        - some angiosperms have male & female on same flower, diff flower same plant, or different individual plants entirely
    - flowers later evolved to enclose carpels & stamens in petals which evolved from leaves

pollination:
    - diversity of floral structures are directly linked to pollination
    - not specific to angiosperms (gymnosperms also have pollination), but angiosperms have targeted pollen movement
    - pollination: pollen transfer from anther to compatible, receptive stigma
        - out-cross pollination: pollen & stigma bred from different species
    - pollen that lands or wrong stigma (or anywhere else) is wasted:
        - wind pollinated plants waste lots of resources on creating pollen that ends up wasted (reproductive dead end)
    - adaptations that improve chances of pollen grain landing on right stigma (/stigma getting the right pollen grains) inc reproductive success
    - ~80% of angiosperms use animal pollinators
        - diff angiosperms have evolved/specialized to target the right pollinators
            - species pollinated by hawk moths tend to be white & bloom at night
            - species pollinated by land animals tend to be low to ground
            - species pollinated by nocturnal bats tend to be dark and droop down

adaptive significance of floral traits:
    - floral traits can:
        - attract good pollinators
        - deter non-pollinating visitors (animals just there to steal the reward)
        - manipulate visitor behaviour to maximize pollen transfer
    - almost any floral trait can affect pollination including:
        - colour
        - scent (sweet, putrid, etc)
        - shape & size
        - markings (including uv-visible)
        - position
        - pollinator rewards (nectars, oils, heat, etc)
        - flowering time (day, night, season)
    - theory: pollinator-mediated speciation
        - pollinator shifts can be first step in reproductive isolation
        - simple changes in flowers can lead to pollinator shifts
        - experimental crosses & genetic analyses show large changes in flower morphology possible with single mutations
        - experimental verification:
            - isolated AN2 gene for purple colour & inserted into P. axillaris to test whether diff species would have preferences
                - grew both wild & altered in same controlled conditions & found hawk moths preferred white (wild type), and bees preferred purple (altered)
                    - different groups favouring different species -> reprodutive isolation -> speciation

fruits:
    - unlike gymnosperms, angiosperm ovules develop in an ovary
        - ovule: includes integument (seed coat)
        - ovary: additional maternal tissue around ovule (ovarian tissue, fruit)
        - pericarp: ovary wall
    - after fertilization ovaries (usually) ripens & develop into fruit (enormous diversity in the fruiting process)
    - as with flowers, same tissue (ovary) has diversified into many forms & specific functions
    - most seed dispersal structures develop from pericarp and/or ovary tissue
    - general functions:
        - protect developing seed
        - seed dispersal
    - not all fruits are supposed to be eaten: shell of walnut, maple keys
        - ovary tissue can aid in dispersal by:
            - wind: dandelion seed
            - animal fur: burdock
            - explosion: ballistic seed dispersal
            - water: coconut
    - some fruits are meant to be eaten:
        - fruits get eaten (hopefully by intended disperser)
        - fruit flesh gets digested but seeds aren't
        - seeds gets pooped out in new place (moist microenvironment pre-provisioned with nutrients)
        - fruits could be hidden & forgotten: squirrels with acorns
        - chances are that the seed will end up where the animal goes which will likely be a suitable environment (since the same animal ate the fruit from the same plant)
            - some most animals don't like chillies since we can taste spice from capsaicin whereas the targeted disperser (birds) can't taste it
        - takes much more energy to make fruit than wind-dispersed seed
            - but if each is much more provisioned & has higher chance of survival, it is a beneficial ecological strategy

the 2 angiosperm groups:
    - flowering trees & grasses are indeed both angiosperms
    - 2 groups within angiosperms: monocot vs dicot
        - based on morphology, angiosperms have traditionally been divided into two major groups
        1. monocotyledons (monocots): (all grasses including some flowers & trees)
            - cotyledons: one
            - vascular tissue: scattered through stem
            - leaf veins: parallel
            - phyletic: monophyletic
            - examples:
                - all grasses
                - corn
                - wheats
                - sugarcane
                - oats
                - rice
                - irises, orchids, lillies, palms
            - monocots have lost some features (such as woodiness)
        2. dicotyledons (dicots): (prettier & have bigger species)
            - cotyledons: two
            - vascular tissue: circular arrangement
            - leaf veins: branching
            - phyletic: paraphyletic (since little monocot branch evolved from dicots)
            - examples:
                - everything not monocot
                - include beans & soy
    
incredible modularity of plants: especially notable in angiosperms
    - plants produce multiples of most morphological structures, that can take each other's place (cut off top branches, side branch will replace it)
    - can create vastly different structures with the same tissue or analogous structures via diff pathways/tissues
    - allows huge flexibility for individuals & evolutionary lineages

angiosperms & humans:
    - almost all the plants we eat are angiosperms (except pine nuts, algae, & fiddlehead ferns)
    - interesting chemistry involved with fruits & flowers:
        - angiosperms need to synthesize new chemicals in order to create new pigments & scents in order to attract specific pollinators
        - humans rely on a lot of chemical compounds from angiosperms:
            - poison: cyanide
            - perfumes: flowers
            - insecticide: permethrin (produced in chrysanthemum flowers)
            - coffee: caffeine (defensive compounds/poisons of seeds)
            - drugs: heroin & opiates
            - spices, pigments, spices



EXAM:
    - angiosperm radiation: 125-80 Mya (cretaceous period), angiosperm coponent of world's flora goes from ~0% to >75%
        - adaptive radiation: 1 lineage produces unusually large # of descendant species adapted to many habitats & ecological niches
        - angiosperms are one of the great adaptive radiations in history of life (unsure when first evolved, but they took off rapidly once they did)
        - reproductive isolation (cause of rapid speciation): diverging species no longer interbred, no gene mixing (last & often hardest step in speciation)
            - flowers are most associated w/ speciation since they're the reproductive structures (directly involved in mating choice, change in flowers -> change in gene mixing -> formation of new species)
            - divergence in flower structures can quickly lead to reproductive isolation (carpel, stamen, petals diversified -> fantastic array of sizes, shapes, colours)
    - what is a flower?: for plant sex (esp. for finding mates)
        1. stamen (male structure): anther, filament (produce pollen grains)
        2. carpel (female structure): stigma, style, ovary (produce ovules, protect developing embryo)

    - adaptive significance of floral traits:
        - floral traits can: attract good pollinators, deter non-pollinating visitors, manipulate visitor behaviour to maximize pollen transfer
        - almost any floral trait can affect pollination (colour, scent, shape & size, markings (including uv-visible), position, pollinator rewards (nectars, oils, heat, etc), flowering time (day, night, season))

            - pollinator shifts can be first step in reproductive isolation, simple changes in flowers can lead to pollinator shifts
            - experimental crosses & genetic analyses show large changes in flower morphology possible with single mutations
    - fruit: same tissue (ovarian tissue) has diversified into many forms & specific functions (like w/ the flower)
        - ovaries usually ripens after fertilization -> develops into fruit (enormous diversity in fruiting process)
        - general functions: protecting developing seed, seed dispersal (most seed dispersal structures develop from pericarp &/ ovary tissue)
        - not all fruits are meant to be eaten: sheel of walnut, maple keys 
            - 4 ways ovarian tissue can aid in dispersal: wind (dandelion seed), animal fur (burdock), explosion (ballistic seed), water (coconut)
        - some fruits are meant to be eaten: seeds will likely end up where animal goes which will likely be a suitable env. (animal will likely stay in places w/ similar conditions)
            - fruits get eaten (hopefully by intended disperser) -> flesh gets digested but seeds aren't -> seeds gets pooped out in new place (moist env. pre-provisioned w/ nutrients)
            - fruits could be hidden & forgotten (squirrels w/ acorns)
            - takes more nrg to make fruit than wind-dispersed seed but it's a beneficial ecological strategy if inc. provisioning & complexity means inc. survival rate
    - 2 angiosperm groups: 4 differences of monocots vs dicots
        - species: all grasses incl. some flowers & trees | prettier species & bigger species
        1. cotyledons: 1 | 2
        2. vascular tissue: scattered through stem | circular arrangement
        3. leaf veins: parallel | branching
        4. phyly: monophyletic | paraphyletic (since little monocot branch evolved from dicots)
        - examples: all grasses, corn, wheats, oats, rice, sugarcane, irises, orchids lillies palms | everything not monocot, bean & soy
        - monocots have lost woodiness
