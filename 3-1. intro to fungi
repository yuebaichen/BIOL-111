L7 - intro to fungi {5}

1. phylogeny of fungi {5}:
    -1) significantly more related to animals/amoeba than plants
    -2) fungi is one of 3 major lineages of large, terrestrial eukaryotes
    -3) first fungi evolved in the ocean ~800-1000 Mya
    -4) colonized land ~500 Mya (before plants, very ancient)
    -5) innovated nutrient extraction in terrestrial environment

2. fungi facts {9}:
    -1) 110k named species
    -2) hard to study evolutionary history of fungi due to few fossils
    -3) general phylogeny is poorly sorted; taxonomy mostly based on reproductive structures & DNA (sorted into big clusters/groups)
        - fungi phylogeny is an example of polytomy
    -4) varies from single cells (ex. yeast) to to huge multicellular structures (ex. mushrooms, molds)
    -5) modern fungi fill many niches {3}: (in/on humans, in food, oceans, caves, radioactive environments)
        --1) free-living/symbiotic
        --2) beneficial/pathogenic
        --3) single/multicellular
    -6) fungi are as ubiquotous as bacteria
    -7) critical to ecosytem function (as plant symbionts & decomposers) across all ecosystems
    -8) has a wide range of human uses
    -9) largest organism in the world (fungal network): The Humongous Fungus, Malheur National Forest, Oregon (Armillaria ostoyae, "honey mushroom") - discovered by Dr Catherine Parks in 2000

3. features of fungi {4}:
    (1-> structure {3, 0, 2}: single-celled or filaments (mycelia)
        ((*1-> cell walls like plants but contain chitin like animals
        ((*2-> has no complex transport systems
        ((1-> single-celled fungi {}:
            -1) single-celled species occur in several taxonomic groups (not monophyletic)
            -2) "yeasts" are unicellular fungi, others include cytrids (parasite)
            -3) difference between fungi&bacteria {2}:
                --1) fungi are eukaryotes, bacteria are prokaryotes
                --2) cell wall composition: chitin for fungi, peptidoglycan for bacteria
        ((2-> mycelia {4}:
            -1) mycelia can pack together to form mushrooms
            -2) hyphae can be bundled together to form {2}: 
                --1) mycelium that can grow through things (soil, wood, food)
                --2) fruiting bodies (mushroom)
            -3) long&thin structure improves absorption&SA (hypha cell has very high SA:volume ratio) & makes fungi master absorbers
            -4) cell is a loose term for fungi (some cells have more than one nucleus) {1, 0, 1}:
                --1) hyphae are usually separated by cross-walls (septa) with large pores that allow (rapid) passage/transport of nutrients, even nuclei
                --*) hyphae is like a microscopic superhighway; individual cells/tubes with big gaps/ports between cells that allow for nutrients to flow through
        ((3-> fungi morphology {3}: 
            -1) cells are 90-95% water (dramatic shrinkage of mushrooms upon cooking)
            -2) moist habitat is essential to maintain large fungal structures (cells rely on turgor pressure)
            -3) fungi spores & small fungi can survive in harsher conditions
    (2-> nutrition {4}: heterotroph (absorb food directly from surroundings)
        ((1-> network of filaments leads to immense SA for absorption
        ((2-> contrary to autotrophic photosynthetic plants, fungi secrete digestive enzymes externally {2}:
            -1) saprophyte: feeds on dead things (ex. white rot fungus)
            -2) symbiont: gets fed by others, not always intentionally (symbiosis two organisms living closely together; does not necessary mean beneficial relationship - parasite is symbiotic)
        ((3-> ways of nutrient absorption of different fungi have impacted their ecology&evolution
        ((4-> impact of fungi nutrition {0, 4}: examples that shape exosystems
            (((ex1. lignin {6}:
                -1) plant lignin&celulose are the most abundant molecules on earth (lignins = ~25% of land-based biomass); lignin&cellulose are tightly intertwined together into ligninocellulose
                -2) fungi were the first & most efficient decomposers of lignin
                -3) fungi are one of few organisms that can break down cellulose
                -4) without fungi, energy in dead matter would not be recycled back into ecosystem
                -5) fungal enzymes break down lignin to free up cellulose for consumption
                    -1) also makes compounds available for consumption by other organisms like bacteria
                -6) believed that fungal enzymes evolved during a period in history where coal stores rapidly stopped accumulating (due to sudden appearance of organisms that can break down plant material)
            (((ex2. lichen {4}:
                -1) example of fungal symbiosis: fungi + algae/cyanobacteria
                -2) very abundant: 6% of earth's surface (deserts, tundra, forests)
                -3) important in succession: lichens are often the first organisms to habitat post-glacial-retreat or post-volcanic environments
                -4) secrete acids -> help break down rock -> kickstarts soil formation & ecological succession
            (((ex3. mycorrhizae {5}:
                -1) plants provid fungus with sugars&carbon; fungus absorbs nutrients from soil which are passed along to the host plant
                -2) 80% of vascular plants partner with fungi to get nutriest from soil
                -3) hyphae massively increase SA of root system for absorption
                -4) 100 times thinner than thinnest plant root; vastly extend reach/absorption of plant root system
                -5) incredibly important for plant health&productivity (almost all vascular plants have them)
            (((ex4. chytrid fungi {8}:
                -1) example of symbiotic fungi that shapes ecosystems (but not in a good way)
                -2) group of single-celled fungi that are very devastating pathogens to amphibians
                -3) grows on the skin of amphibians (frogs, salamanders); since amphibians perform many essential funtions via skin (respiration, water absorption, thermoregulation), the fungus rapidly kills them 
                -4) believed to have arisen in Korea in the last century (1960s) & rapidly spread throughout the world due to human activity
                -5) people started to notice that frogs were dying off on mass around the world; 60 species of frogs were already extinct by the time the fungus was identified in the 1990s
                -6) ~120 frog species today have gone extinct or near extinction due to chytrid fungus
                -7) persists as spores in the environment; almost impossible to wipe out
                -8) one of most devastating wildlife diseases of the last 50 years (no possibility for intervention)
    (3-> reproduction {}: sexual, asexual (very diverse)
        ((1-> reproduction is an important characteristic distinguishes different groups of organisms; shapes evolution very strongly
        ((2-> fungi have evolved very diverse/complicated reproduction system
        ((3-> different to other organisms in that some fungi have haploid&diploid phases
        ((4-> asexual {2}: (no mixture of sexual material)
            -1) simplest: fragmetation (hyphae can break off into a new organism)
            -2) slightly more complex: during haploid phase (can produce haploid vegetative spores)
        ((5-> sexual reproduction {3, 1}:
            -1) very different from sexual reproduction in plants/animals
            -2) often only see sexual reproductive structures in the form of mushrooms
            -ex. Basidiomycete {4, 0, 1}
                --*) fungi have a dikaryotic phase where cells fuse without fusion of nucleus/genetic materal
                --1) compatible individual haploid mycelia/hyphae fuse to initiate sexual cycle (plasmogamy)
                --2) produces a dikaryotic mycelium (1 cell, 2 haploid nuclei); this stage can last decades
                --3) produce mushroom with gills lined with dikaryotic basidia: haploid nuclei fuse (karyogamy) -> diploid nuclei -> recombination
                --4) undergoes meiosis (diploid -> haploid) -> basidium containing 4 haploid nuclei -> appendages -> basidiospores -> produce basidiospores
            -3) mushrooms analogous to fruits; fruiting body containing "seeds"
    (4-> dispersal {4}: spores
        -1) spores are tough structures evolved/specialized for dispersal
        -2) spores can persist in unfavourable (dry) conditions for very long (unlike hyphae)
        -3) small size of spores facilitates airborne dispersal
        -4) interesting dispersal mechanisms {3}:
            --1) ejection mechanisms (ex. puffball, poke them & they explode with spores)
            --2) animal dispersers (ex. stinkhorns, produce scent of rotting meat & stinky stuff to attract flys/bettles)
            --3) infect/possess animals (ex. "zombie fungus"/ophiocordiceps); transitions from symbiont to saprophyte

4. humans & fungi {}:
    - edible mushrooms (all mushrooms are edible, but some of them only once - food & drugs)
    - yeasts have been adopted by humans for millenia to take advantage of their fermentation (breakdown of sugars -> alcohols + CO2) to produce:
        - alcohols (grains, fruits)
            - yeast that naturally grow on skin of grapes that creates wine
            - yeast for brewing beer
        - bread (sour dough, baozi)
        - soy sauce
        - cheese (blue cheese)
    - mycotoxins: fungi can produce toxins that kill other organisms 
        -ex. penicillin producing fungus that kills bacteria; penicillin (antibiotic) was derived from fungi
        -ex. cyclosporin produced by fungi to reduce rejection of organ transplants
        -ex. ergot alkaloids that clot/thicken/stem blood used to treat migraine, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, prevent excessive bleeding during labor, create of hallucinogenic drugs
    - bioremediation (especially white rot fungus that devours lignin)
        - white rot fungus to break down pulp&paper industry waste
    - bio control insect pests via fungal pathogens instead of chemical pesticides

5. definitions {16}:
    -1) heterotroph: organism that cannot make its own food by carbon fixation & derives nutrition intake from other sources of organic carbon in the form of plants/animals
    -2) autotroph: organism that can produce its own food from inorganic sources
    -3) yeast: sugar consuming fungi that is used to cause fermentation&leavening (rising&softening of dough/batter)
    -4) hyphae/hypha: long, branching, filamentous structures of fungi; important for growth
    -5) mycelium/mycelia: root-like structure of fungus consisting of a mass of branching hyphae
    -6) mycorrhizae: “fungus root” describes a generally mutually beneficial relationship between the root of a plant & the fungus that colonizes the plant root
    -7) chytrid fungi (chytridiomycota): simple microscopic fungi widespread in fresh&brackish water that invades thin permeable skin of amphibians
    -8) chitin: fibrous structure consisting of large, structural polysaccharide (carbohydrate) made from chains of modified glucose found in the exoskeletons of insects & the cell walls of fungi
    -9) spore: sexual/asexual reproductive cell consisting of a cell wall that encloses a mass of cytoplasm & a nucleus (usually adapted for dispersal & survival for long periods of time under unfavourable conditions)
    -10) saprophyte/saprotroph: organism that feeds&grows on dead organisms; breaks down complex organic material & absorb the simplre products
    -11) saprophytic: organisms that obtains food by absorbing dissolved organic material from products of organic breakdown&decay
    -12) symbiont: organism that lives in a symbiotic relationship with another organism
    -13) plasmogamy: fusion of cytoplasm of two or more cells (usually without fusion of nuclei)
    -14) karyogamy: fusion of nuclei of two haploid (contains 1 set of chromosomes) cells
        --1) results in formation of diploid nucleus containing 2 sets of chromosomes, one from each parent
        --2) zygote: cell formed by karyogamy
    -15) polytomy: node on phylogeny where more than two lineages descend from a single ancestral lineage (indicates uncertainty in descendent lineages or possibility of simultaneous speciation)
    -16) dikaryotic: organism that contains two genetically distinct nuclei in the same cell
