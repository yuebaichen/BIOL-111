    - indirect observations: pasteur & koch
    - symbiosis of bacteria: fine line between mutualism & pathogenesis
        - some bacteria change their env. which effects other organisms that live there (lower pH)
        - most plants & animals have a microbiome (microbes living in env. in/on part of body): we have loads of bacteria in/on us, 50:50 cells, 100:1 genes 
    - bacteria are ancient (stromatolite fossils from 500 Mya to billions of years old): also living stramatolites found today in intertidal zones
    - bacteria evolve rapid (prooves that no such thing as evolution proof)
    - advantages of being small: higher SA to volume ratio, shorter time to replicate DNA
    - 3 levels of biological organization: metabolisms of each level are linked (end of one is the beginning of the other)
        1. individual cell: metabolism & replication (continuous input of nrg & matter to keep cell out of thermodynamic eqm, turning back to raw materials)
        2. population: variation & evolution (replication causes variation, reproduction causes competition -> increased mean fitness, evolution)
        3. community: consumption & nutrient cycling (diff. species linked by consumption & trophic interactions, must be in mass & nrg balance)
    - summary of the cell:
        - plasma membrane: phospholipid bilayer separates aqueous outside & inside env. controlling all traffic in & out of cell
            - 3 types of embedded proteins in plasma membrane:
                1. transport: channels allow passage of specific molecules & ions
                2. signal: receptors bind external ligands & change behaviour inside cell
                3. adhesion: hold cells together (responsible for biofilm formation)
        - dual system of the cell
            1. metabolism: synthesizes new biomass, membrane needed to prevent products to diffuse away
            2. information: needed to synthesize metabolism, membrane needed to link info to metabolic sys.
        - growth & reproduction: large cells are inefficient due to low SA:volume
            - cells will aquire biomass until it has to split -> reproduction (division of biomass & replication of info)
    - 6 steps of DNA replication:
        1. unwinding at origin, loading of 2 helicases onto DNA
        2. SBB (single stranded binding) proteins keep strands apart, topoisomerase prevents supercoiling of yet to be zipped DNA
        3. ATP hydrolysis drives helicase through zipped DNA
        4. primase synthesizes RNA primer on single strand portions
        5. replisomes (w/ DNA polymerase) synthesize daughter strands simultaneously (only codes 5'-3', 3'-5' laggin strand needs new primers -> okazaki fragments, primer overwritten w/ DNA & fragments patched by ligase)
        6. 2 replication forks meet at termiation site, replisome unloaded, daughter chromosomes separate
    - bacteria:
        - has nucleoid instead of nucleus
        - typical genome formed of a single usually circular molecule of DNA in closed loop
        - plasmids: small DNA molecule that occur in some bacteria that can encode for various functions (not essential & not always beneficial)
            - encodes for stuff like antibiotic resistance & helps bacteria adapt to new env.
            - replicate at the same as chromosomes but daughter plasmids don't receive equal numbers
            - some plasmids encode conjugation (transfer of genetic material through direct contact) allowing plasmid transfer btwn. bacteria via pilus (thin protein tube for conjugation or adhesion)
        - chromosome replication & cell division are linked in bacteria: 
            - replicated daughter chromosomes move apart -> FtsZ proteins migrate to centre of cell -> FtsZ ring initiates septum formation -> daughter cells separate
    
    - central dogma: flow of genetic info within biological sys.
        1. DNA: info storage made of base pairs found in nucleus (euk) or cytoplasm (prok)
        2. mRNA: 
            1. transcription (info retrival) made of single strand of bases found in cytoplasm
            2. translation (product assembly) made of triplet codons found in ribosome
        3. protein: product made of 20+ diff. amino acids found in the cytoplasm
    - ribosome: macromolecular mRNA translation machine for protein synthesis
        - 2 subunits of ribosomes: 
            1. small 30S: 16S rRNA that reads the mRNA
            2. large 50S subunit: contains 5S & 23S rRNA that forms polypeptide changes of amino acids
        - 6 steps of ribosome/mRNA translation: 
            1. ribosome forms & docks on start codon of mRNA (AUG) w/ tRNA at P site 
            2. matching tRNA to codon accepted at A site -> peptide bond forms btwn amino acids of A & P sites
            3. P tRNA releases chain to A tRNA 
            4. ribosome moves 1 triplet codon forward on mRNA -> empty tRNA discarded at E site, new peptidyl tRNA at P site
            5. cycle continues until stop codon (UAG, UGA, UAA) is reached
            6. ribosome disengages & separates into 2 subunits -> protein folds up & diffuses away
    - 2 explanations to genetic redundancy: why amino acids? why only CHNOS? why only 20? A < N^L (given 20 amino acids, 4 bases & 3 bases per codon would be a more parsimonious soln)
        1. frozen accident
        2. optimal biochemistry considering versatility, cost of syntheisis, etc
    - 2 most important attributes of life: 
        1. genetic info -> self replication & heritability (genotypic)
        2. metabolism -> complexity (phenotypic)
    - 3 theories of origin of life:
        1. special creation: supernatural (not science)
        2. panspermia: life on earth evolved from life from outer space & was able to thrive upon reaching suitable conditions
            1. undirected: interplanetary dispersal of microbes via meteors
            2. directed: delibrate seeding of planets
            3. misdirected: galactic pollution by spacecraft
        3. spontaneous generation: unambiguously chemical -> indisputably living, self-assembly -> evolution
            - 3 processes required for life:
                1. growth: exergonic chemical rxns that release nrg for synthesizing organic molecules -> metabolism
                2. reproduction: separated fragment of growing system capable of continued growth itself
                3. inheritance: products of reproduction resembles parent more closely than random member of pop. -> genetic info
            - 2 possible routes for origin of life:
                1. genetics first: RNA world of early oceans populated by self-replicating RNA strands -> cells -> all living organisms
                2. metabolism first: possible abiotic metabolism at chemical diseqm at hydrothermal vents
                    - higher pressure & temp -> exergonic rxns
                    - organic synthesis: dissolved CO2 reduced by H2 -> organic molecules (anoxic metabolism)
    - metabolism:
        - electron transport: length of arrow on redox tower from left to right running downward indicates nrg released
            - electron donor: reduced -(oxidation, e- loss)-> oxidized (gives e- to acceptor & releases nrg)
            - electron acceptor: oxidized -(reduction, e- gain)-> reduced (becomes donor & continues reacting)
        - 5 stages of evolution of metabolism:
            1. glycolysis & fermentation (3.5 Bya): CH20 -> CH20' (2 ATP), 6-carbon glucose -> 3-carbon pyruvate -> nrg (ATP) & reducing power (NADH)
            2. anaerobic resp (3.45 Bya): Cred + SO4 -> Cox + HS- (>>2 ATP), glycolysis -> oxidation of pyruvate -> citric acid cycle -> electron transport chain
            3. anoxygenic photosyn. (3.4 Bya): CO2 + H20 -> CH2O + 2S, first photosynthetic bacteria
            4. oxygenic photosyn. (2.7 Bya): CO2 + H2O -> CH2O + O2, cyanobacteria cased the great oxygenation event (0.0001% -> 21%)
            5. aerobic resp.: CH2O + O2 -> CO2 + H2O (~36 ATP), oxygen breathing organisms
            - chemiosmotic nrg storage by membranes:
                - lipid bilayer impermeable to ions: separates inside & outside electrical charge
                - charge imbalance from redox rxns pump cations (H+) across membrane -> electrochem gradient -> cations return spontaneous due to conc. diff. across membrane
                - cations return via ATP synthase channel -> drives oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP -> creates high nrg phosphate bond which is later hydrolyzed to support biosynthesis
    - winogradsky column: simple way to visualize interactions btwn diverse metabolic sys.
        - top| iron oxidizing bacteria, cyanobacteria (oxygenic photosyn), sulfur & non-sulfer bacteria (anoxygenic photosyn), desulfovibrio (anerobic resp), clostridia (fermentation) |bottom 

    - molecular phylogenetics: tracking evolution using molecular data 
        - hemoglobin was used at first to track evolution but Carl Woese championed the use of ribosomal RNA due to its universality
        - Woese's proposed 3 domain tree of life: archaea & eukaryotes are sister groups
        - revised "eocyte hypothesis" tree: eukaryotes embedded within archaea formed due to endosymbiosis of bacteria by archaea (not parsimonious due to ester -> ether -> ester)
    - bacteria: unicellular, cell wall & cell membrane, lack organelles, nucleoid instead of organized nucleus (prokaryotic), cell wall w/ peptidoglycan
    - archaea: unicellular, prokaryotic, cell membrane phospholipid w/ ether bonds, cannot photosynthesize, distinct metabolic pathways & genes to bacteria (includes extremophiles previously thought to be bacteria)
    - possible model for first eukaryote: endosymbiosis (entangle, engulf, endogenize)
    - LUCA: last universal common ancestor -> bacteria & archaea
        - had phospholipid bilayer plasma membrane
        - information: single circular DNA genome, helicase, DNA polymerase
        - translation: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (synthesize mRNA), tRNA, ribosome
        - metabolism (anerobic): TCA cycle, ability to synthesize all 4 bases & most amino acids
    - 2 phylogenetic methods: align sequence, identify changes at homologous sites (diff. sequence), then
        1. compute dist. matrix -> join most similar sequences -> map on tree & repeat (dist. based)
        2. choose tree structure to minimize # of mutations (parsimony based)

    - critique of the tree: tree of 1%
        - tree based on a small portion of the total genes may not accurately represent evolutionary history of the other genes
        - other genes may be involved in HGT that can't be easily represented in a vertical tree
    - 2 pieces of evidence of endosymbiotic theory:
        1. morphological similarity (Margulis' microscopy)
            - 3 hypotheses of Marguli's & their evidence: free-living ancestor -> organelle (evidence)
                1. cyanobacteria -> chloroplast (16S RNA similarity, similar gene content in metabolic genes, many genes lost/transferred to host nucleus)
                2. alphaproteobacteria -> mitochondria (16S RNA similarity, similar gene content in metabolic genes, many genes lost/transferred to host nucleus)
                3. spirochete -> flagella (morphological evidence only)
        2. DNA similarity using molecular phylogenetics (Dolittle & Bonen)
    - HGT: transfer of genetic material horizontally across branches of tree of life (first revelaed by molecular phylogenetics)
        - conjugation: exchange of genetic material in the form of plasmids via pilus
        - endosymbiosis: HGT involving transfer of entire genome
        - some genes from endosymbiont genome transferred to host genome over time
        - phages: transduction 
            1. lytic cycle: phage infects bacteria -> injects DNA -> lyses host genome -> some host genome gets accidentally packaged in new phages -> transducing phages
            2. transducing phage w/ bacterial genome -> inject DNA into another bacteria species w/o killing it -> transduced bacteria cell
    - virus: likely originated from ancient RNA cells predating LUCA, tiny & make up little biomass but VERY abundant
            - tiny protein package containing a DNA/RNA genome 
            - not concidered a cell (no organelles)
            - not capable of reproduction w/o host
            - adaptation to one thing typically leads to poor performance in another (coevolution)
        1. eukaryotic virus: single stranded RNA encapsulated by protein coat (capsid), membrane made of 3 proteins (spike, membrane, envelope)
            - receptors are specific to tissue & cell type
            - reproduction cycle:
                - binding & entry -> release viral genome -> tricks host ribosome to translate viral genome & polymerase 
                -> RNA replication, transcription, translation -> proteins + nucleocapsid -> virion formation -> exits cell & does damage via exocytosis
        2. phage: linear DNA genome in protein coat, has stalk that injects DNA into bacteria/archaea
            - important in ecosystem to impose massive selective pressure on overabundant species
            - phage therapy to kill deadly bacterial infection
