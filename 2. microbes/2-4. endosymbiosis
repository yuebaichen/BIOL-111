L8 - 2.4: endosymbiosis {4}

1. history of genome sequencing (history behind knowledge/techniques used to support LUCA & tree of life) {5, 0, 1}:
    -1) 1976: first phage (virus that infects bacteria)
    -2) 1995: first bacterium
    -3) 2005: 100 bacteria, thousands of viruses (more sequencing led to ability to make more detailed phylogenetic trees)
    -4) 2015: 10k+ bacteria (can build bigger, better phylogenies)
    -5) today: too many to count (easily 10k+ E. coli genomes, 10k+ M. tuberculosis genomes)
    -*) sequencing is usually focused on pathogens but have shifted to include environmental bacteria

2. updating the tree of life {4}:
    (1-> Ciccarelli et al. (2006) {3}:
        -1) included 191 geneomes of different species in a tree
        -2) based on an alignment of 31 genes (mostly ribosomal) present in 1 copy per genome (didn't just use 1 gene like Woese)
        -3) major branches: bacteria, archaea&eukaryotes as sisters
    (2-> Laura Hug et al. (2016) {4}: major update
        -1) included 30k genomes of cultured bacteria
        -2) added 1011 metagenome-assembled genomes (never been cultured, just sequenced from environment & assembled into a genome)
        -3) discovered entire superphylum "Candidate Phyla Radiation" of uncultured bacteria (ancient unknown group)
        -4) also added the Asgard branch & the TACK superphylum (sister to the Asgard branch) that is thought to have given rise to eukaryotes
    (3-> problem with the tree {5}:
        -1) critique: "the tree of one percent"
        -2) a tree based on ~100 genes may not represent the evolutionary history of the other ~2k genomes in a typical prokaryotic genome
        -3) rest of the genes may be involved in "horizontal" processes (such as endosymbiosis) that are not easily represented by a (vertical) tree
        -4) rest of genes might not follow vertical tree structure since they've been swapped from branches horizontally
        -5) tree with branches growing up vertically don't have branches growing cross-branches horizontally
    (4-> evidence of endosymbiotic theory {2, 0, 1}:
        -1) morphological similarity (Margulis' microscopy)
        -2) DNA similarity (molecular phylogenetics): Dolittle&Bonen
            --1) compared cyanobacteria's 16S RNA with eukaryotic algae's 18S RNA (homologous to 16S RNA)
            --2) findings: algae contains nuclear RNA that is eukaryotic; chloroplast is cyanobacterial
        -*) summary of Margulis' hypotheses & their evidence {3*3}:

3. summary of endosymbiotic theory & HGT (horizontal gene transfer) {4}:
    -1) endosymbiosis is a special case of HGT involving an entire genome (whole cell gets eaten)
    -2) some genes from endosymbiont genome are transferred to host genome over time (another form of HGT) (most likely bacteria -> archaea, formation of interdependence)
    -3) more genome sequencing shows extent of HGT is much greater than expected: tangled tree as opposed to neat vertical tree
    -4) missing aspect of the tree: viruses (vector of HGT that could be the cause some of tangles in tree)

4. viruses {3, 2}:
    (1-> what is a virus? {6}:
        -1) tiny protein package containing a DNA/RNA genome
        -2) not considered a cell (no organelles)
        -3) not capable of replication without a host cell
        -4) all forms of life are infected by viruses (LUCA likely had viruses)
        -5) all viruses use host resources (nucleotides, amino acids, etc) to build more copies of themselves
        -6) some viruses are more virulent (killing/deadly) than others ("some just tag along for the ride without doing much harm")
    (ex1. eukaryotic virus - coronavirus {8}:
        ((1-> viral particle made up of {3}:
            -1) genetic material consisting of single-stranded RNA (protected by nucleocapsids)
            -2) encapsulated by a protein coat (capsid, weird geometric looking shield thing)
            -3) lipid bilayer consisiting of 3 membrane proteins {3}:
                --1) spike
                --2) membrane
                --3) envelope
        ((2-> causes respiratory illness
        ((3-> genome sequence from early 2020 enabled rapid development of vaccines&treatments
        ((4-> virus replication varies but all use host cell machinery {6}:
            -1) binding & viral entry (binds to cell receptor)
            -2) release viral genome
            -3) host cell ribosome translates viral genome & polymerase
            -4) RNA replication&transcription
            -5) replicated genomic RNA & subgenomic transcripts are translated
            -6) structural proteins combine with nucleocapsid -> virion formation -> exits cell & does damage via exocytosis
        ((5-> receptors are specific to tissue/specie cell type (lung cells have different receptors than skin cells)
        ((6-> similarity between SARs-CoV2 & other CoV {5}:
            -1) 96% bat CoV
            -2) 91% Pangolin CoV
            -3) 80% SARS-CoV
            -4) 55% MERS-CoV
            -5) 50% common cold CoV
        ((7-> SARS-CoV2 spread to humans from other animals but can still infect other animals (deer, cats, dogs; although less effective)
        ((8-> spreading of SARS-CoV2 {3}:
            -1) bat reservoir: unknown location
            -2) wild/farmed intermediate host: unknown location, within Huanan market
            -3) humans: Huanan market -> communities near market -> wider Wuhan -> international spread
    (ex2. phage {6}: virus that infects bacteria/archaea
        ((1-> phage morphology {4}:
            -1) consist of DNA genome in a protein coat (looks like lunar lander)
            -2) has a stalk to inject its DNA into other cell
            -3) highly diverse (size, shape, gene content)
            -4) linear double-stranded DNA, 3k-500k base pairs
        ((2-> phages as a vector of HGT {3}: transduction 
            -1) lytic cycle {4}: lytic phages that lyse/explode/kill bacteria; imposes selective pressure (resist or die)
                --1) phage infects bacteria
                --2) injects its own DNA into bacteria
                --3) lyses the bacterial genome
                --4) some bacterial genome gets accidentally packaged into new phages
            -2) transducing phage with bacterial genome can inject its DNA into another bacteria species; DNA can get integrated in the transduced cell
            -3) lysogenic cycle {1}: lysogenic phages that integrate DNA
                --1) key genes that make cholera a pathogen is entirely coded by phages & integrated into the bacterial genome
        ((3-> phages are everywhere & very abundant (predators that kill bacteria, impose very strong selective pressure) {4}
            -1) ~10^31 phages on earth
            -2) sea water: 10^(5-6) phages (/g or /ml), outnumber bacteria 10:1
            -3) freshwater sediment: 10^9 phages (/g or /ml), outnumber bacteria 20:1
            -4) forest soil: 10^9 phages (/g or /ml), outnumber bacteria 70:1
        ((4-> phages are important in the ecosystem {2}:
            -1) vectors of HGT
            -2) often target the most abundant bacteria & keep them in check ("kill the winner") {0, 2}
                --ex1. could potentially terminate cyanobacteria blooms in lakes
                --ex2. could potentially keep pathogens like V. cholera under control
        ((5-> phages are linked in cycle of coevolution:
            -1) defined as mutually imposed selective pressures (evolution of one affects the other, adaptation&counter-adaptation)
            -ex. mechanism {3, 0, 1}:
                --1) phage must attach to receptor protein on bacterial surface during first stage of infection
                --2) some mutations in receptor gene can confer resistance to phages
                --3) phages will then be under selection to bind to the mutated receptor 
                --*) Red Queen dynamics (Alice Through the Looking Glass): neither bacteria or phage go extinct but are under constant pressure to adapt&counter-adapt
        ((6-> phage therapy {2}:
            -1) engineered bacteriophage successfully cures multidrug resistant infection in severely ill 15-year old
            -2) research team screened 10k+ phages from SEA-PHAGES (at McGill: MIMM 390/391) for ability to kill infecting bacteria
    (2-> adapting to one thing usually leads to poor performance in another {0, 2}: adaptation for one species can bring tradeoffs in infecting another
        -ex1. SARS-CoV2 experimentally evolved to have mutation in spike protein of amino acid change of tyrosine to phenylalanine at position 453 (Y453F) which makes it better at infecting ferret/mink {1}
            --1) mutation Y453F reduced the ability of the virus to infect human airway cells
        -ex2. mutant cholera (ompU) caused by intra-patient phage predation leads to evolutionary tradeoff in not being able to colonize patient's gut system {1}
            --1) must maintain some ancestral cholera (susceptible to phages) in order to survive
    (3-> viruses are tiny but very abundant {3}:
        -1) ~10^30 viruses in the ocean
        -2) ~10^23 infections happen every second
        -3) make up little biomass but make up the majority in numbers/abundance



EXAM:
    - critique of the tree: tree of 1%
        - tree based on a small portion of the total genes may not accurately represent evolutionary history of the other genes
        - other genes may be involved in HGT that can't be easily represented in a vertical tree
    - 2 pieces of evidence of endosymbiotic theory:
        1. morphological similarity (Margulis' microscopy)
            - 3 hypotheses of Marguli's & their evidence: free-living ancestor -> organelle (evidence)
                1. cyanobacteria -> chloroplast (16S RNA similarity, similar gene content in metabolic genes, many genes lost/transferred to host nucleus)
                2. alphaproteobacteria -> mitochondria (16S RNA similarity, similar gene content in metabolic genes, many genes lost/transferred to host nucleus)
                3. spirochete -> flagella (morphological evidence only)
        2. DNA similarity using molecular phylogenetics (Dolittle & Bonen)
    - HGT:
        - endosymbiosis: HGT involving transfer of entire genome
        - some genes from endosymbiont genome transferred to host genome over time
        - phages: transduction 
            1. lytic cycle: phage infects bacteria -> injects DNA -> lyses host genome -> some host genome gets accidentally packaged in new phages -> transducing phages
            2. transducing phage w/ bacterial genome -> inject DNA into another bacteria species w/o killing it -> transduced bacteria cell
    - virus: likely originated from ancient RNA cells predating LUCA, tiny & make up little biomass but VERY abundant
            - tiny protein package containing a DNA/RNA genome 
            - not concidered a cell (no organelles)
            - not capable of reproduction w/o host
            - adaptation to one thing typically leads to poor performance in another (coevolution)
        1. eukaryotic virus: single stranded RNA encapsulated by protein coat (capsid), membrane made of 3 proteins (spike, membrane, envelope)
            - receptors are specific to tissue & cell type
            - reproduction cycle:
                - binding & entry -> release viral genome -> tricks host ribosome to translate viral genome & polymerase 
                -> RNA replication, transcription, translation -> proteins + nucleocapsid -> virion formation -> exits cell & does damage via exocytosis
        2. phage: linear DNA genome in protein coat, has stalk that injects DNA into bacteria/archaea
            - important in ecosystem to impose massive selective pressure on overabundant species
            - phage therapy to kill deadly bacterial infection
