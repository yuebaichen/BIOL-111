L2 - evolutionary origins {3}

1. evolutionary/phlyogenetic biodiversity varies through time&space {2}:
    -1) #^phylogeny: a (usually) branching tree depicting evolutionary (ancestor-descendent) relationships; a group of organisms with a common ancestor^#
    -2) #^phylogenetic: evolutionary development/diversification of a specific feature of an organism^#

2. fun facts {4}:
    -1) coleoperta: phylogeny of the major groups of beetles
        -*) 400k species, 40% of insects, 25% of all species
    -2) ~70k-97k species of weevils
    -3) millions of arthropod (insect, arachnid, crustacean) species make up perhaps half of all species on earth
    -4) ~8.7 million eukaryotic (made of nucleus containing cell(s)) species

3. #^evolution {2}: changes in allele (variant form of gene that affects traits) frequency across generations^#
    (1-> two basic ways of studying evolutionary change depending on type of genetic variation {2}:
        ((1-> #^Mendelian genetic variation {0, 1}: differences among genomes of members of the same species^#
            -ex. consider 1 gene with 2 possible alleles (A or a)
                - diploid (presence of two complete sets of chromosomes in a cell) individuals will have two copies of this gene, one from each parent
                - individual can exhibit one of 3 genotypes: homozygous (AA), homozygous (aa), or heterozygous (Aa)
                    - #^genotype: total sum of genes transferred from parents to offspring; genetic make of an organism^#
                    - #^homozygous: having identical alleles for a particular gene on homologous chromosomes (paired chromosomes that carry the same genes, one from each parent)^#
                    - #^heterozygous: having two different alleles for a specific trait/gene^#
                - genetic variation occurs when all individuals are not genetically identical
                - populations can be considered as pools of genotypes&alleles (“gene pool”)
        ((2-> #^quantitative variation {1}: distinct phenotypic variation among members of the same species#^
            -1) genetic changes in quantitative traits are controlled by changes in allele frequency at multiple genes & are often heavily influenced by the environment
    (2-> key mechanisms of evolution {5, 1}:
        ((1-> #^mutation {2}: changes in chromosomes&genes which typically manifests physically (the ultimate source of all genetic variation)^#
            -1) mutations change the genetic code -> generates new alleles -> may change amino acid sequences or alter gene expression -> may have phenotypic effects
                - mutation rates in roundworms: 1 mutation in 100M nucleotides copied, 2.1 mutations per genome per generation
                -ex. mutation with phenotypic effects: different wing&abdomen shapes in Drosophila
            -2) most mutations decrease fitness & are considered deleterious
                - #^fitness: survival & reproductive success^#
                - #^deleterious: injurious to health^#
                - the average mutation reduces fitness by ~2%
                - beneficial mutations (“hopeful monsters”) are extremely rare & are likely to be of small effect
        ((2-> #^genetic drift {2}: change in gene pool of a population that takes place strictly by chance^#
            -1) causes random changes in allele frequency
            -2) evolution happens completely randomly due to an event wiping out random portion of the population
        ((3-> #^natural selection {2, 2}: adaptive process in response to environment & competition to improve fitness^#
            (((1-> Darwin’s & Wallace’s insight {3}:
                -1) all organisms have the potential for exponential growth yet most populations remain relatively stable; implies high mortality in nature (LOTS OF DEATH)
                -2) traits {3}:
                    --1) vary among individuals
                    --2) influence survival
                    --3) are heritable
                -3) prediction: traits that improve survival should increase in frequency or size through time
            -ex1. artificial selection of Drosophila across 35 generations completely diverged population into low&high bristle count
            -ex2. natural example of evolutionary change (over one generation): 1976 Daphne Major drought & evolution of finches
                - small seeds were quickly exhausted & only larger seeds were left; beak sizes were larger in the next generation
                - some genes underlying this heritable beak trait variation have been identified & shown to also change in allele frequency during this period in this population
            (((2-> selection&evolution are highly variable: favoured traits can vary drastically throughout generations (data from 30+ generations of finches shows all kinds of variance in evolutionary patterns)
        ((4-> #^sexual selection {2, 0, 1}: competition between members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex^#
            -1) #^intra-sexual {0, 1}: male-male competition^#
                -ex. stags (male red deer) return to hind’s (female red deer) home range to compete for them by roaring, walking parallel, & fighting with antlers during autumn breeding season
            -2) #^inter-sexual {0, 1}: female choice^#
                -ex. female widow birds prefer males with longer tails
            -3) secondary sexual traits evolve as a compromise between natural&sexual selection
        ((5-> #^gene flow {1,1}: movement/transfer of genetic material from one population to another^#
            -1) often opposes effects of divergent natural selection
            -ex. exchanging individuals two varying lines of a species would reduce their divergence
                -*) causes frequencies in two populations to be more alike
        -ex. drunkards walk {2}:
            -1) evolution is a result of a balance of mutation (drunk stumbling), natural selection (slope/valley), sexual selection (hot girl), genetic drift (getting pushed or helped up), and gene flow (bungee tied to another drunk)
            -2) evolution often results in species at either end of the spectrum over time (in ditch - large or small beak), not the middle
