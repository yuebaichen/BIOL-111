L8 - endosymbiosis - viruses {}

Origin of eukaryotes: Are they just archaea? 
    (x-> Hypothesis: the common ancestor split into 2 branches,
        1. Bacteria
        2. Archaea and eukaryotes.
    However it was proven to be false, instead the Eocyte hypothesis suggests that it split in a different way: 
        1. Bacteria
        2. Archaea, 
            Eukaryotes are only a branch of archaea 

    Culture independent DNA sequencing of deep sea hydro thermal vents show that: 
        All new archaea super phylum, a group in archaea are the known nearest relatives to eykaryotes. However, they grow very slow and must cross-feed with other bacteria to live and obtain essential nutrients
            Lokiarchaeota
            thorarchaeota
            odinarchaeota 
        The bacteria that Lokiarchaeota lived with could become mitocondrion. Through a process of entangle, engulf, endogenize. 
            The ancestral prokaryotes diversified into mitocondrion ancestors, then through endosymbiosis absorbed into the ancestral eukaryotes.
            ex. Eukaryotic algae could have taken photosynthetic plastids(chloroplasts) from photosynthetic bacteira such as blue green algae
                Discovered by looking through a microscope and Discovered the structural similarities between a mitochondria and bacteria. 

    The ancestors developed into compelx cells that had:
         nucleus, mitocondrion, membrane. 
         
    Which developed into : 
        Plants, animals, fungi, algae, protists. 

LUCA- Last universal common ancestor of all living organisms
    All cells today descend from a single cell that lived in the ocean a long time ago. 
    All other linearages from LUCA became extinct. 
    The two daughter cells of LUCA are
        1. Bacteria
        2. Archaea
    Traits of LUCA were concluded from the common traits that still exist in both bacteria and archaea. 
        1. They have a cell
        2. They had a phospholipid
        3. They had a DNA genome
        4. They had a single circular chromosome 
        5. The information to metabolism DNA is dependent on the RNA polymerase
        6. They all have tRNAs. 
        7. They all have ribosomes
        8. They all have TCA cycle to do carbon metabolism and electron trasnport
        9. They all have the ability to synthesize all 4 bases of DNA/RNA and amino acids. 
    
    More genome sequences means a bigger phyligeny. 
    191 genomes based on alignment of 31 mowt ribosomal genes. 
    Follow their mutations to infer a tree. 
    Other super phylum candidates were Discovered(ancient groups that noone really knew)

    However we cannot base 100 genes to represent the entire evolutionary history of the other 2000 genes in a prokaryotic genome. 
    This discovery was thus called the tree of evolution of 1%
    Any horizontal processes that grew into each other was not able to be shown. 

    Compared rRNA of 16s in cyanobacteria to 18s rRNA with eukaryotic algae. Discovered them to be homologous. 
        Algae contains nuclear ribosomal RNA--> eukaryotic. 
        But chloroplast is cynobacterial. 
    Which provides evidence for the hypothesis that cyanobacteria was ancestor to eukaryotic chloroplasts. 
    The same was true for alphaproteobateria which turned into the mitochondria. 

    however the spirochete was questionable. ****

    Another key component that was missing from the tree was viruses. 
     #^__^#    
        Tiny pack of protein that contains DNA or RNA genome. 
        Not a cell
            No cytoplasm
            No ribosome
        Not capable of replication without a host cell. 
        All forms of life are infected by viruses, LUCA probably too
        All viruses use host resources to help replicate themselves
            Animo acids
            nucleotides
        Some are more deadly than others. 

    Ex. Corona virus(a eukaryotic virus)
    Feature: 
        1. In middle encapsulated single stranded RNA viral genome
        2. A protein coat 
        3. Lipid bilayer, 3 membrane proteins
            Spike
            membrane 
            envelope
        4. Genome sequence enabled development of vaccines and treatments. 

    Cycle goes: 
        1. Viral protein attaches to receptor on the outside of a eukaryotic cell. (such as human airway to COVID)
        2.Viral genomes enters ribosome, start duplicating its polymerase. 
        3.then RNA replication and trasncription 
        4. Make new viral particles 
        5. Through exocytosis leaves the cell. 

    Identifying viruses: 
        COVID is 96% similar to bats, 91% similar to pangolin, 55% similar to SARS COVID 1, ect..
        They face tradeoffs as well during their evolution
            Being better at transmitting through 1 species will decrease its effectiveness towards another. 
        
    Phage: virus that infects bacteria or archaea. 
        highly diverse in: 
            Shape
            size 
            gene
        Linear double stranded DNA. 
        Can transform HGT on bateria. 
        outnumber bacteria by from 10x to 70x

        Benefits: 
            1. Control pathogen population 
            2. Kill most abundant bacteria. 
        Co-evolution: mutation happen on host to resist infection, while viruses mutate as well to cope with the resistance. 
        ex. ompU bacteria good at anti-phage, tradeoff being bad at transmission to mammals. (lost the ability through evolution)
