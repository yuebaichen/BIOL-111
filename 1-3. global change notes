L3 - ecology & evolution of global change {4}

1. forms of global change {6}:
    (1-> temperature {2, 0, 1}: 
        -*) change is heterogeneous (variation - different proportions of inc & dec)
        ((1-> droughts & fires {1, 4, 1}: 
            -*) temperature changes -> change in precipitation patterns -> more frequent, severe, & intense droughts & fires)
            -1) fires are important natural process in ecosystem change but their current magnitude&frequency are much higher due to temperature & precipitation changes
            -ex1. vapour pressure deficit in amazon -> dryness -> massive wildfire
            -ex2. northern Quebec fires, Yellowknife fires
            -ex3. percent area experiencing drought has drastically increased (during drought years) which had dramatic effect on accelerating fire
            -ex4. Jerusalem Fire from Napa valley, California (aug 11, 2015)
        ((2-> hurricanes & floods {2, 1}: 
            -*) temperature changes -> change in precipitation patterns -> more frequent, severe, & intense hurricanes & floods
            -1) data shows precipitation events are accelerating & increasing in intensity
            -2) floods also influenced by changing patterns of snow melt
            -ex. massive floods in Ottawa in 2019
    (2-> habitat loss {0, 4}:
        -ex1. massive loss of forest Amazon for pasture & timbre harvesting
        -ex2. palm oil industry in Borneo (southeast asia - 3rd largest island in the world) destroyed old-growth forests by replacing them with palm plantations
        -ex3. Vancouver Island old growth have been extensively harvested (more than half)
            -*) during preservation efforts of old growth forests, paper was “bad” & plastic was “good”; plastic was the saviour
        -ex4. destruction of the Prairies 100 years ago for agriculture
    (3-> pollution {5}:
        ((1-> plastic {0, 3, 1}:
            -ex1. big gyres of plastics in oceans
            -ex2. micro & nano plastics in oceans
            -ex3. plastic in soil & rivers
            -*) ingestion of plastic have been shown to have considerable negative impacts on some organisms, particularly smaller organisms
        ((2-> salt {1, 1}:
            -1) salt is bad for freshwater since most freshwater organisms can’t deal with excessive salt
                -*) companies get around spraying traditional NaCl salt but are actually still spraying salt, just a different kind (calcium salt, magnesium salt, potassium salt, etc)
            -ex. freshwater aquatic ecosystems have been drastically altered in areas near roads where road salt is sprayed
        ((3-> noise {1}:
            -1) noise from planes, cities, boats, etc significantly affect organisms that communicate with sound
        ((4-> light {0, 3}:
            -ex1. artificial lights at night causes major problems for nocturnal animals or animals who migrate at night
            -ex2. ambient light obscures celestial patterns & moonlight, making it hard for animals to figure out where to go
            -ex3. ambient light negatively impacts organisms that signal at night using various light patterns (fireflies)
        ((5-> atmospheric {0, 2}:
            -ex1. carbon dioxide emissions -> increased greenhouse effect
            -ex2. methane emissions -> increased greenhouse effect
    (4-> ocean acidification {0, 1, 1}: decrease in pH of earth’s oceans due
        -*) carbon dioxide + water + carbonate ion -> 2 bicarbonate ions (which dissociate into carbonate ions & hydrogen ions which eventually form H3O acid)
        -ex. increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere binds more carbonate ions from the water that impedes calcification during shell formation
            -*) effect: as the partial pressure of CO2 in seawater reaches ~1800ppm -> decreasing supply of carbonate ions crosses a threshold -> aragonite (form of calcium carbonate commonly used in shells) spontaneously dissolves (shells of animals will dissolve)
                -*) aragonite is more soluble in cold water; cold water also takes up more CO2 compared to warm water -> threshold in cold waters will be well before 1800 ppm (will reach threshold by 2070)
                -*) balance is changing; change in pH is already occurring in surface waters & is hard to reverse
    (5-> invasive species {0, 1}:
        -ex. native populations have been replaced by invasive species
    (6-> hunting & harvesting {2, 2}:
        -ex1. (commercial fish):
            - gill-netting for fish kills bigger fish & lets smaller fish through
            - fish sizes are shrinking since only small fish survive
        -1) estimates state 5-10% of ocean is being fished constantly -> massive population declines particularly in top predators (decrease in CPUE - catch per unit effort)
        -2) causes really big rates of change in populations
        -ex2. trophy hunting caused decline of horn size for trophy hunted animals & increasing frequency of tusklessness in elephants

2. ecological & evolutionary effects of global/environmental change {2, 0, 1}:
    (1-> under global change (& other disturbances), species become maladapted (poorly adapted for their environment)
        -*) populations can decline to extinction/extirpation if they don’t shift their phenotypes/genetic traits to better match new environment
    (2-> conceptualization of (mal)adaptation {2}: (well adapted phenotypic distribution sits beneath optimum)
        -1) scenario 1: abrupt shift in optimum cuts off majority of distribution (may lead to extinction)
        -2) scenario 2: gradual shift in optimum (phenotype distribution shifts along to follow optimum)
    -*) shifting is usually conceptualized as natural selection but can also be sexual

3. ways populations better match their phenotypes to the environment {2}:
    (1-> move to an appropriate location
    (2-> stay in place but change phenotypes to suit the new optimum
        -1) plasticity: change in behaviour, physiology in response to change in environment
            -*) #^physiology: study of the function of organisms & their parts^#
        -2) evolution: change in allele frequency & morphology due to shifting optimum
            -*) #^morphology: study of size, shape, & structure of organisms^#

4. ecology & evolution of global change {6}:
    (1-> maladaptation of organisms {2, 6, 1}:
        -1) evolutionary trap: evolved behaviour/trait is detrimental to survival/reproductive ability
        -2) ecological trap: rapid environmental change that leads organisms to prefer to settle in poor quality habitats
        -*) lots of evidence that world is changing in ways that increase occurrence of ecological traps
        -ex1-6. butterfly feeding from hat, flies in dustpan, frog eating light, albatross eating plastic, polarized patterns of light attracting aquatic & aerial insects, organisms thinking asphalt mirage is water
    (2- change in population abundances {1, 2}:
        -1) 30-60% of populations for a set of organisms are declining depending on latitude; other species are increasing
        -ex1-2. Galapagos tortoise extinction, Labrador duck hunted to extinction
    (3-> frequency of extirpations/extinctions {1}:
        ((1-> species are comprised of many different populations {2}
            -1) although entire species have not gone extinct, many populations have
            -2) persistence of many species lies in the diversity of populations they have but as those populations die out, the species as a whole becomes much more likely to go extinct
    (4-> change in habitat ranges of species {2, 1}:
        -1) habitat elevation of species is increasing {0, 1}
            -ex. turkey vultures moving north to BC
        -2) things specialized in high elevation will lose low elevation ranges as everything shifts up due to warming climate
            -ex. marine life shifting to northward {0, 1}
        -ex. unexpected shifting: marmots in Vancouver shifting breeding later due to increased snow
    (5-> change in traits of species {1, 3}:
        - rate of trait change in haldanes (h) = standard deviations per generation, shows that almost all big changes in average traits were due to human disturbance
        -ex1. average size of all salmon populations is shrinking, particularly dramatically in recent years
            -*) move north to grow more quickly, mature earlier, & come back smaller
        -ex2. commercial cod fishery in Atlantic Coast of Canada had massive catches in 1970s & declined dramatically to 1% of population by 1990
            -*) cod in 1990 was half the length of cod in 1960
        -ex3. the faster fish stocks are harvest, the more rapidly the fish get smaller (study suggests that fishing specifically is the cause of size declines)
    (6-> evolutionary rescue {2, 0, 1}: persistence of a population (that would have gone extinct) through natural selection acting on heritable variation
            -*) ultimate test of evolution; whether it will occur is an area of intense current research
            -1) case 1: adaptive change keeps population out of risk zone (no extinction)
            -2) case 2: adaptive change insufficient for persistence (extinction)
