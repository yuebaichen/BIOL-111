L6 - tree of life {4}

1. history of the tree of life {7}:
    (1-> history of taxonomy {3}: tree as a classification scheme (before phylogenetic trees)
        -1) Aristotles’s Scala naturae, 400BC
        -2) Linnaeus’ Systemae Naturae, 1735
        -3) classification without any concept of evolution; species are immutable; species are what they are, list of species
    (2-> history of phylogeny {3}: trees as a depiction of evolution
        -1) Lamarack, 1809: adaptations are acquired (started depicting common ancestry & hierarchical relation)
        -2) Darwin, 1837: adaptations via natural selection (started drawing trees)
        -4) Darwin, 1859 (On the Origin of Species)
    (3-> big surprises from molecular phylogenetics {2}: (past 50 years)
        -1) discovery of brand a new domain of life (archaea)
        -2) extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT, tangled tree instead of organized vertical tree)
    (4-> history of molecular phylogenetics:
        -1) Watson & Crick, 1953: discovery that DNA contains genetic material “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing (base pairs) we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material”
        -2) Crick, 1958: suggests the idea of protein taxonomy; using protein sequences (sequences of amino acids) to classify genetic diversity
        -3) Pauling & Zuckerlandl, 1964 {2}: (application protein taxonomy)
            --1) Molecular Clock: suggest that mutations will occur at a fairly regular pace over a period of time
            --2) analysis based on hemoglobin protein sequences to trace back common ancestor
    (5-> history of bacteria classification {3, 0, 1}: bacteria are notoriously hard to classify
        -*) Darwin: did not think much about the microbial world
        -1) Linnaeus, 1774: refered to the microbial world as “chaos”
        -2) Haeckel, 1866: placed Monera (his idea of microbes) at the base of the tree giving rise to more complex forms
        -3) Chatton, 1937: first to use distinction between Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes
    (6-> building a comprehensive tree of life {3}:
        -1) morphology&metabolism has limited information (not enough to create a comprehensive classification scheme)
        -2) molecular phylogeny provides the perfect tool (analyze DNA sequences of bacteria)
        -3) which molecule (gene sequence) to use to trace/build ancestry of the tree of life? {1, 0, 2}: (align sequences->choose method->infer tree)
            -1) ribosomal RNA: molecule used to build the first trees of life (universal marker; homologs (homologous trait) in both prokaryotes & eukaryotes)
            -*1) DNA helicase & ATP synthase: not as conserved & different versions in prokaryotes&eukaryotes 
            -*2) hemoglobin: only in animals; similar structures exist in prokaryotes (myoglobin) but not simmilar enough to trace mutations between eukaryotes
    (7-> Carl Woese: 
        ((1-> championed use of 16S ribosomal RNA as universal marker to build tree of life (1970s)
            -1) part of ribosome; key&ancient part of every cell on earth that is key to the process of translation of proteins
            -2) universally conserved: 18S in eukaryotes but can be aligned to track mutations
            -3) anchor with conserved regions to observe for variation in variable areas
            -4) Woese did not have easy methods to amplify DNA in his time & went through very laborious procedure of analyzing DNA gel using radioisotope labels
            -5) “not elegant science, but a big slog”: required culturing large amounts of bacteria (had to extract huge amounts of DNA)
            -6) isolate & grow bacteria from hot springs, extract DNA, fragment, radio label, run on a gel to produce a “fingerprint”/short DNA sequence
        ((2-> one day, Woese’s lab fingerprints a methanogen (archaea) to see where it would fall within the prokaryotes {2}
            -1) finds that branch is a little closer to eukaryotes than prokaryotes but is so deep that it would've branched off 3.5 billion years ago (close to origin of life)
            -2) bacteria & archaea had been grouped together due to morphological similarities but are actually genetically very distinct
        ((3-> Woese & the three-domain tree of life {3}:
            (((1-> proposed three-domain tree of life
                -1) origin {2}:
                    --1) bacteria: domain of unicellular organism that has a cell wall but lack organelle & an organized nucleus (prokaryote "before nucleus"/no nucleus)
                    --2) split {2}:
                        ---1) eukarya: domain of organisms that have cells with a nucleus & other organelles (eukaryotic)
                        ---2) archaea: domain of unicellular prokaryotic organisms initially classified as bacteria but later reclassified due to distinct differences from bacteria:
                            ~1} cell wall does not contain peptidoglycan
                            ~2} cell membrane uses ether linked lipids as opposed to ester linked
                            ~3} cannot perform photosynthesis
                            ~4} have distinct metabolic pathways & genes
            (((2-> prokaryotes are not a domain since they are not monophyletic
                -1) monophyly: shares common ancestor that excludes other groups
                    --2) monophyletic: group of a clade
                    --3) clade: group consisting of an organism & all its descendants
                    --4) paraphyletic: group of organisms that contain a common ancestor & some (but not all) of the descendants OR doesn’t include other branch at common ancestor (does not meet cladistic criterion/test)
                    --5) polyphyletic: group that contains clades from multiple separate branches of the tree of life, not forming a complete clade (does not meet cladistic criterion/test)
            (((3-> Woese continues to add branches to the tree {2}
                --1) halophilic&thermoacidophilic bacteria also turn out to be archaea
                    ---1) halophilic: extremophile that thrives in high salt concentrations
                        ~*) extremophile: organism that is able to live/thrive in extreme environments
                    ---2) thermoacidophlic: extremophile that that is both thermophilic&acidophilic; grow under high temp & low pH
                --2) distinctness of archaea also supported by phospholipids (ether bond in archaea instead of ester bond in bacteria/eukarya)

2. refining the tree (with more data) {2}:
    (1-> hypotheses {2, 0, 1}:
        -1) hypothesis 1 (parsimony suggestion): monophyletic archaea
        -2) hypothesis 2 (molecular phylogeny suggestion): paraphyletic archaea (eukaryotes are embedded within archaea tree)
        -*) paraphaletic archaea hypothesis is disliked/opposed due to non-parsimoniousness; goes against parsimony with the reversal of phosolipid structure back to ester bonds
    (2-> are we basically archaea? {2}:
        ((1-> "three domains hypothesis"/"Woese's tree": Carl Woese initially placed archaea as sister group to eukaryotes
        ((2-> "eocyte hypothesis" {3, 1}: later research sequencing more 16S RNA of more genes (other ribosomal genes across genome) found that eukaryotes are actually embedded within archaea (emerged within archaea)
            -ex. Asgard archaea superphylum (unofficial grade in taxonomy intermediate between phylum&kingdom) was discovered by culture-independent (analyzed samples extracted directly from source) {5}
                -1) deep branching group within archaea; branch really closely to eukaryotes on tree
                -2) nearest known relatives of eukaryotes
                -3) discovered Lokiarchaeota, Thorarchaeota, Odinarchaeta
                -4) experiment process/findings {3}:
                    --1) very difficult to culture: took 12 years to grow (very slow growing)
                    --2) Lokiarchaea had to grow in co-culture with other specific archaea&bacteria
                    --3) Lokiarchaea has no organelle-like structures but has complex morphology
                -5) inferred metabolic map of Lokiarchaea: involved in syntrophy (cross-feeding) with bacterial partner & archaeal partner {2}
                    --1) bacterial partner reduces sulphate & produces amino acids necessary for Lokiarchaea to grow
                    --2) Lokiarchaea uses amino acids to make pyruvate -> TCA cycle (citric acid cycle, powerhouse of cellular respiration)
            -1) most common ancestor of eukaryotes&archaea (progenitor of eukaryotes) -> most common ancestor of eukaryotes -> diversified to form more complex life (other eukaryotic branches)
            -2) possible model for origin of eukaryotes (inferred from extant syntrophy between archaea&bacteria) {3}: entangle, engulf, endogenize
                --1) entangle: get as close to cross-feeding partner as possible so that molecules/nutrients diffuse easily between partners
                --2) engulf: in order to maximize cross-feeding
                --3) endogenize: free living bacteria becomes organelle in cell (evolutionary & reproductive fate of both become interdependent)
            -3) origin of the entangle, engulf, endogenize idea {3}:
                --1) Lynn Margulis (1970): Origin of Eukaryotic cells (hypothesized with only microscopes before invention of DNA sequencing)
                --2) ancestral prokaryote -> ancestor of mitochondria -> absorbed into ancestral eukaryote via endosymbiosis
                --3) also suggested that photosynthetic algae acquired photosynthesis via endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria

3. LUCA {2}:
    (1-> all cells today descended from a single cell (unknown stuff at base of tree) that lived in the ocean long ago called LUCA (last/"most recent" universal common ancestor) {3}
        -1) all the other cells alive then gave rise to lineages which subsequently became extinct & have left no descendants
        -2) LUCA divided to give rise to two daughter cells:
            --1) one was the ancestor of all living eubacteria
            --2) the other was the ancestor of all living archaea
        -3) best hypothesis: endosymbiosis event between archaea & bacteria led to origin eukaryotes
    (2-> portrait of LUCA (hypothetical reconstruction based on genome sequencing comparing shared universal features of extant archaea&bacteria): likely components of cell
        -1) phospholipid plasma membrane
        -2) information {4}:
            --1) DNA genome
            --2) helicase (split DNA to 2 strands)
            --3) DNA polymerase (synthesizes new strands of DNA)
            --3) single circular genome
        -3) translation {3}:
            --1) DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (synthesize mRNA from DNA templates)
            --2) tRNAs (link between mRNA & amino acid sequences of protein)
            --3) ribosome (make proteins)
        -4) metabolism (anerobic) {2}:
            --1) TCA cycle (carbon metabolism) & electron transport chain to make ATP&NADH
            --2) ability to synthesize all 4 bases of DNA&RNA, & most amino acids

4. phylogenetics {3}:
    (1-> methods {3, 0, 1}:
        -1) start with a sequence alignment (same idea can be applied to both nucleotide&protein sequences)
        -2) identify changes at homologous sites (different sequence)
        -3) choose a method {2}:
            --1) distance-based: compute a distance matrix between each pair of sequences; join the two most similar sequences, map on tree, & repeat
            --2) parsimony (most simple/fewest events): choose the tree structure that minimizes the total number of mutations (propose no more mutations than necessary)
        -*) evolution is not always parsimonious & is complicated
    (2-> molecular clock example {2}: coronavirus
        -1) SARS-CoV-2 point mutations appear once every ~2 weeks (contemporary evolution)
        -2) this allows us to fit a molecular clock ad build “time trees”
    (3-> how to read a tree {2}:
        -1) phylogenies are like mobiles; branches can rotate but it doesn’t change the meaning
        -2) read distance to the last common ancestor
