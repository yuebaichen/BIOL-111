L6 - tree of life {}

history of the tree of life
- taxonomy: tree as a classification scheme (before phylogenetic trees)
    - Aristotles’s Scala naturae, 400BC
    - Linnaeus’ Systemae Naturae, 1735
    - classification without any concept of evolution; species are immutable; species are what they are, list of species
- phylogeny: trees as a depiction of evolution
    - Lamarack, 1809: adaptations are acquired (started depicting common ancestry and hierarchical relation)
    - Darwin, 1837: adaptations via natural selection (started drawing trees)
    - Darwin, 1859 (On the Origin of Species)
- big surprises from molecular phylogenetics: (past 50 years)
    - discovery of brand new Domain of Life
    - extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
- history of molecular phylogenetics:
    - Watson & Crick, 1953: discovery that DNA contains genetic material “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing (base pairs) we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material”
    - Crick, 1958: suggests the idea of protein taxonomy; using protein sequences (sequences of amino acids) to classify genetic diversity
    - Pauling & Zuckerlandl, 1964: (application protein taxonomy)
        - Molecular Clock: suggest that mutations will occur at a fairly regular pace over a period of time
        - analysis based on hemoglobin protein sequences to trace back common ancestor
- bacteria are notoriously hard to classify
    - Darwin: did not think much about the microbial world
    - Linnaeus, 1774: refered to the microbial world as “chaos”
    - Haeckel, 1866: placed Monera (his idea of microbes) at the base of the tree giving rise to more complex forms
    - Chatton, 1937: first to use distinction between Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes
- morphology&metabolism has limited information (not enough to create a comprehensive classification scheme)
- molecular phylogeny provides the perfect tool (analyze DNA sequences of bacteria)
- which molecule (gene sequence) to use to trace/build ancestry of the tree of life? {3}: (align sequences->choose method->infer tree)
    - ribosomal RNA: molecule used to build the first trees of life (universal marker; homologs (homologous trait) in both prokaryotes & eukaryotes)
    - DNA helicase & ATP synthase: not as conserved & different versions in prokaryotes&eukaryotes 
    - hemoglobin: only in animals; similar structures exist in prokaryotes (myoglobin) but not simmilar enough to trace mutations between eukaryotes
- Carl Woese: 
    - championed use of 16S ribosomal RNA as universal marker to build tree of life (1970s)
        - part of ribosome; key&ancient part of every cell on earth that is key to the process of translation of proteins
        - universally conserved: 18S in eukaryotes but can be aligned to track mutations
        - anchor with conserved regions to observe for variation in variable areas
        - Woese did not have easy methods to amplify DNA in his time & went through very laborious procedure of analyzing DNA gel using radioisotope labels
        - “not elegant science, but a big slog”: required culturing large amounts of bacteria (had to extract huge amounts of DNA)
        - isolate & grow bacteria from hot springs, extract DNA, fragment, radio label, run on a gel to produce a “fingerprint”/short DNA sequence
    - one day, Woese’s lab fingerprints a methanogen (archaea) to see where it would fall within the prokaryotes; finds that branch is a little closer to eukaryotes than prokaryotes but is so deep that it would've branched off 3.5 billion years ago (close to origin of life)
    - bacteria & archaea had been grouped together due to morphological similarities but are actually genetically very distinct
    - Woese proposed the three-domain three of life:
        - origin
            - bacteria: domain of unicellular organism that has a cell wall but lack organelle and an organized nucleus (prokaryote)
                - prokaryote: “before nucleus” - no nucleus
            - split
                - eukarya: domain of organisms that have cells with a nucleus and other organelles (eukaryotic)
                - archaea: domain of unicellular prokaryotic organisms initially classified as bacteria but later reclassified due to distinct differences from bacteria:
                    - cell wall does not contain peptidoglycan
                    - cell membrane uses ether linked lipids as opposed to ester linked
                    - cannot perform photosynthesis
                    - have distinct metabolic pathways and genes
        - prokaryotes are not a domain since they are not monophyletic
            - monophyly: shares common ancestor that excludes other groups
                - monophyletic: group of a clade
                - clade: group consisting of an organism and all its descendants
                - paraphyletic: group of organisms that contain a common ancestor and some but not all of the descendants OR doesn’t include other branch at common ancestor (does not meet cladistic criterion/test)
                - polyphyletic: group that contains clades from multiple separate branches of the tree of life, not forming a complete clade (does not meet cladistic criterion/test)
        - Woese continues to add branches to the tree
        - halophilic and thermoacidophilic bacteria also turn out to be archaea
            - halophilic: extremophile that thrives in high salt concentrations
                - extremophile: organism that is able to live/thrive in extreme environments
            - thermoacidophlic: extremophile that that is both thermophilic and acidophilic; grow under high temp and low pH
        - distinctness of archaea also supported by phospholipids (ether bond in archaea instead of ester bond in bacteria/eukarya)
- refining the tree (with more data):
    - hypothesis 1 (parsimony suggestion): monophyletic archaea
    - hypothesis 2 (molecular phylogeny suggestion): paraphyletic archaea (eukaryotes are embedded within archaea tree)
    - paraphaletic archaea hypothesis is disliked/opposed due to non-parsimoniousness; goes against parsimony with the reversal of phosolipid structure back to ester bonds
- are we basically archaea? if so, which ones?:

phylogenetics
- methods:
    - start with a sequence alignment (same idea can be applied to both nucleotide&protein sequences)
    - identify changes at homologous sites (different sequence)
    - choose a method:
        - distance-based: compute a distance matrix between each pair of sequences; join the two most similar sequences, map on tree, & repeat
        - parsimony (most simple/fewest events): choose the tree structure that minimizes the total number of mutations (propose no more mutations than necessary)
    - evolution is not always parsimonious & is complicated
- molecular clock example: coronavirus
    - SARS-CoV-2 point mutations appear once every ~2 weeks (contemporary evolution)
    - this allows us to fit a molecular clock ad build “time trees”
- how to read a tree:
    - phylogenies are like mobiles; branches can rotate but it doesn’t change the meaning
    - read distance to the last common ancestor


LUCA
- all cells today descended from a single cell that lived in the ocean long ago called LUCA (last universal common ancestor)
    - all the other cells alive then gave rise to lineages which subsequently became extinct and have left no descendants
    - LUCA divided to give rise to two daughter cells:
        - one was the ancestor of all living eubacteria
        - the other was the ancestor of all living archaea
- portrait of LUCA:
