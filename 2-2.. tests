    -*) ^#central dogma: explanation of flow of genetic information within a biological system

2. #^ribosome {6}: macromolecular translation machine consisting of a complex of RNA&protein that perform biological protein synthesis (mRNA translation)
    (1-> RNA polymerase synthesizes a single mRNA molecule from one strand (“antisense” strand) of DNA, producing a working copy of the “sense” strand
        ((1-> #^RNA: polymeric molecule (nucleic acid) essential for most biological functions, either by performing the function itself (non-coding RNA) or by forming a template for production of proteins (messenger RNA)^#
            -*) #^tRNA: adaptor molecule composed of RNA that serves as the physical link between the mRNA & the amino acid sequence of proteins^#
        ((2-> #^polymerase: enzyme that synthesizes long chains of polymers or nucleic acids (used to assembled DNA or RNA)^#
        ((3-> #^sense strand: (coding strand) DNA strand that carries the code to make a protein; has same base sequence as mRNA except for thymine instead of uracil^#
        ((4-> #^antisense strand: (non-coding strand) DNA strand that serves as a template during transcription; read in the opposite direction of sense strand^#
            -*) sense and antisense DNA are two complementary strands of DNA that have opposite orientations&sequences
    (2-> transcription stops when a termination sequence is encountered
    (3-> ~10k ribosomes in a fast-growing bacteria cell; only 10-100 in a slow growing cell
    (4-> ~1-15 copies of ribosomal genes in a bacterial genome
    (5-> ribosomes consists of 2 subunits {2}:
        -1) small 30S subunit (contains 16S rRNA): reads the mRNA
        -2) large 50S subunit (contains 5S & 23S rRNA): forms polypeptide chains of amino acids
    (6-> steps of ribosome translation {6}:
        - ribosome forms and docks on start codon (AUG) of mRNA with tRNA at P site
        - corresponding tRNA to the codon at the A site is accepted and a peptide bond forms between the amino acids of the A & P site
        - tRNA at the P site releases its amino acid onto the tRNA at the A site & becomes empty
        - ribosome moves one triplet codon forward on mRNA; empty tRNA at E site & peptidyl tRNA at P site
        - cycle continues & successive tRNAs donate amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain until stop codon (UAG, UGA, UAA) is reached
        - ribosome disengages & seperates into two subunites; protein folds up & diffuses away

3. redundancy of genetic code {3}:
    (1-> lots of codons code for the same thing
    (2-> (# of amino acids to be specified) < (# of different nucleotides in mRNA)(# of nucleotides per codon)
    (3-> why amino acids? why only C, H, N, O, S? why only 20?
        ((1-> 2 theories {2}:
            -1) “frozen accident” (crick)
            -2) optimal biochemistry in view of versatility, cost of synthesis, etc

4. origins of life on earth {3}:
    (1-> timeline of life on earth {4}:
        (1-> 4.5 bya: origin of earth
        (2-> 4.0-4.5 bya {1}: heavy meteorite bombardment
            -1) 4.0 bya: oldest rock - acosta gneiss, NWT
        (3-> 3.6-4.0 bya {1}: origin of life (very little oxygen, liquid oceans, atmosphere of CO2/H2O/CH4/sulphur gases, relatively cool sun)
            -1) 3.8 bya: oldest sedimentary deposit - greenland
        (4-> 3.2-3.6 bya {2}: possible evidence of cellular organisms
            -1) 3.5 bya: 13/12C light carbon signature (possibly photosynthesis)
            -2) 3.4 bya: Warrawoona (western Australia) stromatolites
        (5-> 2.0-3.2 bya {4}: direct evidence of cellular organisms
            -1) 3.0 bya: stromatolites - Steep Rock, Ontario
            -2) 2.7 bya: abundant stromatolites (cyanobacteria: bacteria capable of photosynthesis)
            -3) 2.5 bya: fully oxidizing atmosphere
            -4) 2.0 bya: gunflint fossils - Ontario (abundant cellular life)
    (2-> history of life on earth {3}:
        -1) mostly microbial
        -2) life only happened once in the universe (to our knowledge)
        -3) how did life evolve? most important attributes of living organisms {2}:
            -1) #^genetic: self-replication&heritability (since these alone confer evolvability)^#
            -2) #^physiological: metabolism, & thus complexity^#
    (3-> 3 theories that have been advanced to explain the origin of life {3}:
        -1) #^special creation: supernatural (not science)^#
        -2) #^panspermia: theory that life on earth originated from microorganisms or chemical precursors of life present in outer space & was able to initiate life upon reaching a suitable environment^#
        -3) #^spontaneous generation (Oparin-Haldane hypothesis): life arose gradually from inorganic molecules with “building blocks” such as amino acids arising first & then combining to make more complex polymers^#
            --*) continuous series of entities linking the unambiguously chemical with the indisputably living, with evolution through natural selection taking over from self-assembly at some early point

5. panspermia {3, 0, 1}:
    (*-> increasing complexity (genome size) over time problem {2}:
        -1) genome size doubles every ~400 million years
        -2) fitting a linear graph to the log transform would result in life originating before the formation of earth (however it is a big assumption to draw such a linear graph)
    (1-> undirected panspermia {3}: dispersal of microbes from planet to planet
        ((1-> taken seriously due to short interval between appearance of permanent oceans & first signs of life
        ((2-> bacteria could be transported by meteors {1}:
            -1) seems likely that some would survive atmospheric heating&impact due to evidence of living bacteria surviving in Egyptian tombs (3.5kya), Canadian permafrost (5+kya), Russian permafrost (3.5mya), amber (25-40mya), salt crystals (250mya)
        ((3-> objections to undirected panspermia {2}:
            -1) low local star density
            -2) low probability of capture (lot of debris from mars but mars is same age as earth)
    (2-> directed panspermia {2}: deliberate seeding of planets by aliens
        ((1-> advantage is that it incorporates an effective dispersal mechanism (except its not effective)
        ((2-> objections to directed panspermia {3}:
            -1) 4by for non-intergalactic intelligent life to evolve on earth; if it took 4by elsewhere, then the total time approaches the age of the universe (only very few planets could have been seeded)
            -2) no convincing evidence for intelligent life anywhere else
            -3) why only bacteria? why not spread some more evolved form of life?
    (3-> misdirected panspermia {1, 1}: galactic pollution by spacecraft
        -ex. NASA landers are sterilized to very high microbiological standards yet still has 300 spores per square meter (bacteria can survive in space - evidence found on the moon)
        -1) attraction of this hypothesis is that we know it could have already happened; perhaps other civilizations have been equally careless

6. spontaneous generation {3}:
    (1-> 2 chemical processes that need to happen for life to be possible {2}:
        -1) #^growth: exergonic chemical reactions that release energy that is available for synthesizing organic molecules as the basis of metabolism^#
            - #^exergonic: metabolic/chemical process accompanied by release of energy^#
        -2) #^reproduction: separation of a fragment of the growing system itself capable of continued growth^#
    (2-> 1 more process is needed for life to evolve from probiotic chemistry {1}:
        -1) #^inheritance: reproduction gives rise to products that resemble their parent more closely than they resemble random members of the same population^#
    (3-> 2 possible routes for the origin of life {2}:
        ((1-> genetics first {3, 0, 2}: the RNA world
            -*1) no reasonable pathway leading directly from a dilute solution of small molecules to a full-fledged DNA-protein cell has ever been found {0, 0, 1}
                --*) this created an impasse in spontaneous origin of life until 1987
            -1) RNA is replicated by RNA polymerases (small RNA replicators exist as viruses today)
            -2) RNA molecules can replicate without cells when provided with raw materials & a replicase {0, 0, 1}
                --*) can also act as enzymes called ribozymes comparable to protein enzymes
                    -*) #^ribozymes: catalyze reactions, including reactions that modify the state of other RNA molecules^#
            -3) #^self splicing introns: first examples discovered that proves genetics first; have been regarded as primitive forms of splicing machinery for eukaryotic pre-mRNAs^#
                -*) #^self splicing: occurs for rare introns that form a ribozyme, performing the functions of a spliceosome by RNA alone^#
                -*) #^intron: any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is not expressed or operative in the final RNA product^#
            -*2) RNA uniquely combines the capacity to replicate with the capacity to direct metabolism {0, 0, 1}
                --*) led to the theory of the RNA world: an early ocean populated by self-replicating RNA strands from which cells & eventually all living organisms descended
        ((2-> metabolism first {5}:
            (((1-> life in Lost City hydrothermal field {1}:
                -1) potential energy source - chemical disequilibrium at hydrothermal vents {2}:
                    --1) at high pressure&temperature (~150oC) - CO2 dissolved in water is reduced to H2 (exergonic reaction)
                        ---*) high pressure due to depth of ocean
                        ---*) high temp due to convection of geothermal heat through seabed
                    --2) #^organic synthesis: CO2 dissolved in seawater is reduced by H2 to form a range of organic molecules in anoxic conditions^#
                        ---*) #^anoxic: absence of oxygen^#

7. metabolism:
    (((2-> metabolism {2*3, 0, 2}:

        |ELECTION ACCEPTER |oxidized form of substance B |-reduction (electron gain)-> |reduced form of substance B  |
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -*1) electron donor gives electron to electron acceptor & releases energy
        -*2) electron acceptor becomes electron donor & continues reacting according to the redox tower
    (((3-> redox tower {3}:
        -1) bacterial metabolism is based on pairing electron acceptors with electron donors
        -2) if oxidation of molecule A (left column) is above the reduction of molecule B (right column) -> reactions can be coupled into a redox reaction -> yielding energy
        -3) arrows drawn in the redox tower yield energy if they run downward from left to right & the amount of energy released is indicated by the length of the arrow
    (((4-> evolution of metabolism {5}:
        -1) glycolysis & fermentation (3.5 bya) {5}:
            --1) glucose + 2NAD + 2ADP + 2Pi —(glycolysis)—> pyruvate + 2NADH + 2ATP + 2H2O + 2H+ —(fermentation)—> ethanol + NAD+ (2ATP)
            --2) glycolysis is the initial stage of energy production
            --3) a 6-carbon molecule of glucose is broken down into a 3-carbon molecule of pyruvate, which generates energy (stored as ATP) & reducing power (stored as NADH) {3}
                ---1) #^pyruvate: simplest of the alpha-keto acids with a carboxylic acid & a ketone functional group^#
                ---2) #^ATP: adenosine triphosphate, molecule that carries energy within cells^#
                ---3) #^NADH: electron transfer molecule; electron donor at top of electron transport chain^#
            --4) if oxygen (or some other alternative) is not available, then pyruvate is the final electron acceptor
            --5) NADH must be re-oxidized to NAD+ as the electron necessary for a new round of glycolysis through a process called fermentation (does not generate energy)
        -2) anaerobic respiration (3.45 bya) {4}:
            --1) glycolysis -> oxidation of pyruvate -> citric acid cycle -> electron transport chain 
            --2) Creducing + SO4- —> Coxidizing + HS- (>>2ATP)
            --3) electron transport chain:
                ---1) electrons can be passed along a series of molecules from more electropositive to more electronegative molecules
                ---2) energy released in fall of potential energy in high-energy to low-energy molecules/ions can be harvested to do work in the cell
                    ~*) in absence of oxygen (anaerobic) some bacteria can use other alternatives to oxygen as the final electron acceptor:
                        ~~1} methanogen -> carbon dioxide
                        ~~2} acetogen -> carbon dioxide
                        ~~3} sulphate reducer -> sulphate
                        ~~4} sulphur reducer -> sulphur
                        ~~5} iron reducer -> ferric iron
                        ~~6} denitrifier -> nitrate
            --4) chemiosmotic energy storage by membranes (ATP synthase) {6}:
                ---1) lipid bilayer membranes are impermeable to ions; separates electrical charge inside from electrical charge outside
                ---2) charge imbalance is caused by redox reactions of the electron transport chain that pump cations (H+) across plasma membrane from inside to outside to create an electrochemical gradient
                ---3) these cations tend to return spontaneously due to the difference in concentration across the membrane
                ---4) cations return through the ATP synthase channel which drives the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to turn into ATP (churns "wheel"/protein complex)
                ---5) creates a high-energy phosphate bond that can then be hydrolyzed to support biosynthesis (jams ADP with phosphate group) {0, 0, 1}
                    ~*} #^biosynthesis: multi-step enzyme-catalyzed process where substrates are converted into more complex products in living organisms^#
                ---6) ATP synthase similar to water mill; bacteria invented the wheel
        -3) anoxygenic photosynthesis (3.4 bya) {1}: photosynthetic bacteria
            --1) CO2 + HS- —> CH2O + 2S
        -4) oxygenic photosynthesis (2.7 bya) {2}: cyanobacteria
            --1) CO2 + H2O —> CH2O + O2
            --2) caused the great oxygenation event (oxygen level from 0.0001% —> 21%)
        -5) aerobic respiration {2}: evolution of oxygen breathing organisms
            --1) CH2O + O2 —> CO2 + H2O (~36ATP)
            --2) electrons are supplied by NAD+ to NADH (most electropositive member of chain) & is passed along a chain of intermediates to the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen (which also received a proton to form water)
