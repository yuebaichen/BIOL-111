L18 - 4.5: inverts 5 - ecdysozoans: what makes an arthropod an arthropod?

4 major groups of ecdysozoa: protosomes with exoskeleton & grow by molting (sister clade to Lophotrochozoa)
    1. nematoda: round worms
        - ~25k described species (~1mil total est species, one of largest animal phyla)
        - characteristics: pseudocoelomates, unsegmented, elongated, circular in cross-section, limbless
            - body protected by elastic cuticle that is molted as nematode grows
        - found in all possible habitats (marine, freshwater, terrestrial, known to thrive in extreme conditions)
        - feed on detritus, bacteria, fungi (many are parasites, 50% of species): free forms play important role in soil nutrition
    2. tardigrada: water bears or moss piglets
        - ~1k described species
        - characteristics: small (0.05-1.5mm long), segmented, 8 short legs
        - inhabit marine, freshwater, & semi-terrestrial envs (moist areas): can survive extreme conditions but are not extremophiles
        - feed by sucking fluids from plants & animals (some are detritivores)
        - can go into cryptobiosis (stopping metabolism for more than 30 years)
    3. onychophora: claw bearing velvet worms
        - ~200 described species
        - characteristics: segmented animals with lobe like appendages
        - inhabit humid terrestrial envs
        - nocturnal ambush predators: best spitters in animal kingdom (5cm animal can spit toxic saliva up to 50cm to immobilize prey)
    4. arthropoda: jointed foot
        - ~1.16mil described species
        - characteristics: segmented animals (reduced segmentation) with jointed appendages & an exoskeleton
        - inhabit all environments
        - use specialized mouth parts to consume variety of foods
        - most diverse eukaryotic group (63% of all eukaryotic species, more than 75% of all animal species)
            - ~10 mil est species: we are losing species faster than we can discover them due to human mediated extinction
    - note: mollusks that have exoskeleton do not moult (Lophotrochozoa)

4 characteristic features of arthropods:
    1. segmented body plan:
        - body segments
        - segments are specialized & fused to form tagma/tagmata
            - tagma: specialized grouping of multiple segments to form coherently functional morphological group
            - created through tagmosis: evolutionary process that creates tagma by modifying & fusing segments
        - diversification based on number & function of segments
        - number of segments varies from <20 (insects & crustacenas) to >100 (centipedes & millipedes)
    2. jointed appendages:
        - biramous (branched) or uniramous (unbranched)
            - ancient arthropods have each body segment associated with single pair of appendages
        - specialized functions: most species have modified some appendages to form other structures (mouth structures, antennae, reproductive structures)
    3. higly developed sense organs:
        - high cephalized
        - elaborate sensory organs including: statocysts, antennae, simple/compound eyes, sensitive hairs, & more
            - compound eyes very good at detecting light & motion but poor at detecting shapes: consists of hundreds of ommatidium
    4. rigid exoskeleton (characteristic of ecdysozoans):
        - non-living exoskeleton secreted by epidermis
        - covers all external surfaces, disgestive tract, & tracheae
        - composed of layers (multi-layered)
        - composition varies from group to group:
            - insects: cuticule of chitin & protein, 
            - crustaceans: cuticle mineralized with calcium carbonate (not huge impediment since crustaceans are aquatic & water bouyancy supports their weight)
        - 5 advantages of rigid exoskeleton:
            1. physical support & protection (from abrasion, predation, parasite entry, desiccation)
            2. provides place for muscle attachment
            3. jointed appendages & exoskeleton allow faster locomotion
            4. allows for possible metamorphosis: opportunity to change morphology between larval & adult stages
            5. location for pigments (camouflage, warning colouration, mating signal)
        - 5 disadvantages of rigid exoskeleton:
            1. inflexible & heavy (if thick & protective)
            2. continuous growth in size not possible: must periodically shed via moulting
                - discontinuous growth in size: mass grows continuously but size changes in stepwize fashion
                    - undergo instars (period between moulting) where size stagnates
                    - size inc dramatically after moulting (ecdysis)
            3. requires energy to form & shed (energy costly)
            4. requires certain level of calcium in water to grow shell (hard water)
            5. respiration through skin is not possible in most cases: need for spiracles (pores) & tracheae (tubes)

systems in arthropods:
    - resp:
        - insects & most myriapods: tubular tracheae (branched to finer tubes) with holes (spiracles) to carry O2 to body cells
            - one of first inverts to transition to land: no gills, no lungs
        - crustaceans: have gills (thoracic cavity or on appendages) since they are aquatic
            - gills vs lungs: gills diffuse oxygen from water, lungs diffuse oxygen from air 
        - chelicerates (originally marine): some have tracheae & spiracles, some have book gills/lungs (horseshoe crabs, spiders, scorpions)
            - spiders have 5 pairs of book lungs with >100 thin membranes (pages in a book) where gas exchange takes place (inc SA)
            - believed that book lungs evolved from book gills (not related to lungs of vertebrates)
    - circ:
        - open system (hemolymph fills body cavity)
        - dorsal tubular heart (1 chamber) with pores (ostia): drives hemolymph into hemocoel (body cavity containing blood/hemolymph) spaces
            - reduced coelom divided into small cavities (hemocoel) filled with hemolymph
        - equipped with pores & valves to generate ONE-WAY bloodstream
        - open vs closed:
            - hemolymph in sinuses (body cavity) surrounding organs
            - see 4.4 for pros of closed
    - musculo-skeletal:
        - skeletal muscles:
            - need a resistor to act against (skeleton)
            - often found in antagonistic pairs (muscles can only pull): arthropod muscles must be packed within exoskeleton
        - external vs internal:
            - flexor & extensor found on opposite sides
            - external skeleton has muscles attached on inside
         
moulting & metamorphosis:
    - insects cease moulting as adults:
        - 2 types of metamorphosis to adult form: opportunity to change morphology & ecological role
            - complete:
                - abrupt changes in form
                - 4 stages: one of which is resting stage (pupa): eggs, larva, pupa, adult
                - often major habitat changes
                - examples: butterflies, moths, beetles, bees, ants, fleas, mosquitoes
                - life cycle example: comet moth
                    - adult female lays eggs (120-170)
                    - larva caterpillars emerge out of eggs (after 2 weeks)
                    - caterpillars feed voraciously & molt: only stops eating when molting (2 months)
                    - time between molts are instars: number of instars depends on species (4 for comet moths)
                    - pupates: insect makes hard shell & will rest inside as pupa (6 months)
                    - adult leaves pupa, slowly stretches out in sun to dry & harden exoskeleton
                    - adult lives for short amount of time to reproduce (comet moth does not eat & only has a few days to reproduce)
            - incomplete:
                - gradual changes in form
                - 3 stages with no "resting" stage: eggs, nymph, adult
                - often no habitat change
                - examples: found in true bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, mites
    - crustaceans continue moulting as adults (but molt less frequently as they age)

what controls moulting:
    - Wigglesworth's experiments using Rhodnius prolixus (kissing bug): father of insect endocriology (insect hormones)
        - Rhodnisus prolixus:
            - blood-sucking insect
            - moults after blood meal
            - can live long time after decapitation
            - transmits Chagas disease (fever, swelling of eyelids)
        - experiment:
            - decapitate third-instar juveniles at different times after blood meal
            - bugs joined with glass tubes both moult into adults (allows hemolymph to flow between bugs)
        - conclusion: blood meal stimulates production of some substance within head that then slowly diffuses through body, triggering a moult
    - hormones & moulting:
        - chemical messengers secreted by endocrine cells
        - distributed by blood & bind to target cell receptors (have target specificity)
        - simple diagram: endocrine pathway
            - stimulus stimulates endocrine cell to secrete hormone
            - hormone released into bloodstream to target cell & elicits a response 
            - response results in inhibition of endocrine cell (feedback loop of inhibition)
        - more realistic pathway: integration between nervous & endocrine system (neuroendocrine pathway)
            - stimulus causes sensor cell to send neural signal to CNS
            - CNS produces neurohormone released into bloodstream to target cell & elicits a response 
            - response results in inhibition of endocrine cell (feedback loop of inhibition)
        - more complicated pathway: neuroendocrine to endocrine (multi-level integration)
            - stimulus -> neurohormone from neuroendocrine pathway -> triggers endocrine pathway -> target cell -> response (2 feedback inhibition loops)
    - arthropod moulting hormones:
        - PTTH brain hormone (pro-thoracico-tropic hormone):
            - produced & stored by brain (neurohormone)
            - production influenced by env cues
            - controls activity of prothoracic gland
        - ecdysone:
            - produced by prothoracic gland & secreted into blood
            - targets cells in epidermis
            - response: results in ecdysis
            - brain respons by shutting off PTTH hormone (negative feedback)
        - juvenile hormone: keeps insect larval
            - secreted in corpus allatum
            - controls metamorphosis
            - declining release influences developmental stages
