L15 - 4.2: inverts 2 - intro to animals II: from one cell to an organism (sponges)

embryonic development: from 1 cell (zygote) to trillions of specialized cells (multicellular organism)
    - 3 main milestones of embryonic development:
        1. fertilization: process of combining a single sperm cell with a single egg cell
        2. zygote: diploid cell resulting from union of two haploid gametes (1st cell of next generation)
        3. embryo: young animal still contained in protective structure (egg shell or uterus)
    - 3 major processes during embryonic development: map of initial/embryonic development
        1. cleavage: multiple rounds of rapid cell divisions (mitotic)
            - process that forms many cells from one cell (morula, blastula) 
        2. gastrulation: involves dramatic rearrangement & movement of cells followed by in-folding/invagination
            - process that forms embryonic tissue layers (2-3)
            - very important at this stage to have well defined axis (hox genes)
        3. cellular differentiation: process in which immature cells take on individual characteristics & reach their mature/specialized form/function
        - map of initial development:
            - cleavage:
                - zygote -> 2-cell stage -> 8-cell stage (blastomere, bud parts) -> morula (solid ball) -> blastula (hollow ball, sponges stop here)
            - gastrulation:
                - blastula -> early gastrula -> late gastrula
                    - anatomy of gastrula:
                        - blastocoel: fluid-filled cleavage cavity & is the basis of the future gut
                        - archenteron: "old gut" digestive space (gut cavity)
                        - blastopore:
                            - forms the mouth in protostomes
                            - forms the anus in deuterostomes
                        - 2 germ layers: organisms with 2 germ layers are diploblastic ("with two buds") (MAJOR EVOLUTION, 2 embryonic cell layers)
                            - ectoderm: "outer skin" -> epidermis & nervous system
                            - endoderm: "inner skin" -> digestive & respiratory tracts
                            - 3rd germ layer: mesoderm "middle skin" -> most internal organs: muscles, skeletal system, part of gonads
                                - organisms with 3 germ layers are triploblastic & have bilateral symmetry ("with three buds") 
                                - MAJOR EVOLUTION, 3 embryonic cell layers & bilateral symmetry
            
3 types of body symmetry: correspondence of size, shape, & relative position of parts on opposite sides of a dividing line, median plane, about a center/axis
    1. asymmetry:
        - no axis divides body into equal halves
        - example: some sponges
    2. radial symmetry:
        - any cut through centre divides the body into equal halves 
    3. bilateral symmetry:
        - single axis divides body into equal halves through midsagittal plane (between eyes)
        - some species evolved to revert to radial symmetry in adulthood (seastar, echinoderms)

sponges: most primitive animal group (phylumm porifera)
    - sponge history:
        - earliest monophyletic branch of animals
        - earliest animals to appear in fossil record (700 Mya)
        - porifera: "pore bearing" 
        - ~9k species, mostly marine
        - only ~100 freshwater species
        - inhabit wide range of habitats: from shallow tidal zones to 9k m deep, from polar to tropic
        - most adults are sessile; still motile as larvae (dispersal)
        - have primitive features (specialized cells but no true tissues/organs)
            - digestion is intracellular
            - respiration & excretion through diffusion
        - have endoskeleton: spicules (small sharp-pointed structure typically present in large numbers) & network of elastic fibres for support
    - sponge morphology is highly variable:
        - adult sponges can be radially symmetrical or bilaterally symmetrical
        - adult sponges come in a variety of sizes: from 2mm to 2m
        - adult sponges exist in a variety of colours & shapes
        - flat sponges found in intertidal zones
        - barrel sponges found in ocean depths
    - sponge feeding:
        - sponges can generate water current for filter feeding
        - sponges depend on generated currents for food, oxygen, & even reproduction
    - sponge anatomy:
        - atrium: internal cavity of sponge lined with choanocyte cells (collar cells) equipped with flagella 
        - coordinated movement of flagella suck water through the pores into atrial cavity, then blows it through the osculum
        - choanocytes take up food & performs intracellular digestion
            - similar to choanoflagellates; collar acts as filter trapping bacteria on the surface
        - consists of 3 main (loose) layers: has no true tissues except epidermis (no organs, muscles, nerves)
            - outer epidermis consists of thin layer of flat epidermal cells 
            - inner epidermis consists of choanocytes
            - middle layer: mesohyl with ameboid cells embedded in a jelly matrix
                - also contains the endoskeleton made up of spicules & spongin fibres
                - support structures in middle layer:
                    - extracellular matrix:
                        - non-cellular 
                        - collagen & glycoproteins
                        - provides some support
                    - spicules: 
                        - calcium or silica
                        - provides rigidity
                    - spongin:
                        - protein fibres
                        - flexible support
                        - high level of spongin: "bath sponge" soft absorbent structure
                        - high level of silica: "glass sponge" highly rigid structure
                            - example: venus' flower basket
    - sponge reproduction: sexual & asexual
        - 2 mechanisms of asexual reproduction:
            - fragmentation (external budding): portion of sponge breaks off & regenerates into a complete new organism
                - not self-induced
                - brought upon by waves or predators
            - internal budding (gemmules): dormant stage 
                - clone of parent
                - takes place through formation of gemmules
                - gemmule: small collection of several diff types of cells enclosed in protective covering
                    - refers to some asexual reproductive structures in plants (as the buds of mosses), sponges, & hydra
                    - mass of cells capable of remaining dormant then later develops into a new individual
                - survival mechanism in harsh conditions in which adult may not survive
                - protective gemmule can develop into adult once conditions are more favourable
            - prediction for evolution of multicellularity from aggregation of single celled organisms:
                - pushing sponge through sieve & incubating -> many individual sponges
        - sexual reproduction:
            - most sponges are hemaphroditic (each individual can produce both sperm & egg)
                - however an individual will only make one type of gamete at a given time (not able to self-fertilize)
            - gametes produced in choanocytes or ameobocytes
            - sperm is concentrated inside "male" sponge & released at once: broadcast sperm (through osculum)
            - sperm is trapped by choanocytes of "female" sponge (same way food is trapped)
                - sperm cells delivered to eggs by ameobocytes & stored in mesohyl where fertilization takes place to form zygote
                - fertilized eggs develop in extracellular matrix
                - larvae released back into water (motile)
                - larvae swim through water while developing
                - larvae eventually settle to the substrate & become sessile
