L17 - 4.4: inverts 4 - annelids & mollusks

intro:
    - sister phyla annelids & mollusks are part of clade Lophotrochozoa
        - closest relatives to flatworms
    - Lophotrochozoa clade was not morphologically obviously & was later presented based on molecular data
        - share similar feeding structure called Lophophore (often coiled ring of ciliated tentacles surrounding mouth)
        - share similar type of ciliated larva called Trochophore (has ciliated ring for mobility & to direct food to mouth)
        - similar DNA sequences (monophyletic group)
    - traits of Lophotrochozoa:
        - protostome animals
        - bilateral symmetry
        - triploblastic
        - coelomates

annelids: segmented/ringed worms
    - general facts:
        - body divided into (repeating) segments
        - ~17k species
        - inhabit moist aquatic or terrestrial envs
        - 0.5mm to 3.5m
        - has coelom used as hydrostatic skeleton
    - segmentation of a polychaete (paraphyletic class of worms):
        - subdivided along length to given appearance of series of rings
        - most segments will have pair of parapodia (appendages) with bristles: used for excretion & locomotion
        - not all segments are identical: gently modified to accomodate specialization of some organs
            - regional differentiation: segments are similar but each can be modified (ex. differentiation of gut)
        - advantages of segmentation:
            1. multiple copies of organs, structures (ex. nephridia, parapodia)
            2. efficient nervous control
                - ganglion in each segment
                - faster responses
                - efficient localized movement
            3. inc body size by unit repetition
            4. regeneration: ability to regenerate even the head region!! (more segments lost -> more difficult to regen head)
        - segmentation examples in other animal groups: also found in arthropods & vertebrates
            - segmentation in rib cage & spinal cord in vertebrates 
            - jointed segments in crustaceans (annelid & arthropod were grouped in same clade before molecular data)
    - annelid systems:
        - nervous: 
            - anterior "brain": cerebral ganglion more active/complex in active forms & simpler in sessile forms
            - brain connected to ventral nerve cord: varies in thickness (dialiates into segments, segmental ganglia)
        - respiratory: skin/epidermis (earthworms) or gills (some polychaetes & oligochaetes, often as extension of parapodia)
        - excretory: tubular nephridia (equivalent to kidney)
        - digestive: complete digestive system (one way w/ mouth & anus) with distinct regions (esophagus, gizzard, intestine)
        - circulatory: "closed", dorsal & ventral blood vessels, pumped by aortic arches ("hearts")
            - 4 advantages of closed circ sys: blood contained within vessels at all times
                1. improved exchange between deeper tissues & surface (O2, CO2)
                2. faster transport of nutrients & gases
                3. requires less energy for distribution
                4. allows development of thicker body (free of diffusion limit from body wall)
    - annelid diversity:
        1. polychaeta ("many hairs"): bristle worms (marine worms)
            - mainly marine
            - detritivores/filter-feeders
            - forms: crawling, burrowing, swimming, pelagic (open water), tube-dwelling, boring
            - more mobile forms have impressive array of sensory organs: eyes, palps (appendages for touch/taste), tentacles
            - sessile forms have reduced head & sense organs but have very well developed tentacles
            - parapodium: muscular flaps (lateral outgrowths/protrusions) with setae (hair/bristle-like structures) for locomotion & respiration
            - separate sexes with external fertilization: trochophore ciliated larvae
            - example: eudistylia sp (fan worms)
                - low tide: withdraws tentacles when exposed to air
                - high tide: projects beautiful crown of tentacles when submerged
            - example: riftia (giant tube worm)
                - can live near hydrothermal vents (almost boiling & toxic level of chemicals to most organisms)
                - has symbiosis with chemeosynthetic bacteria (doesn't depend on light)
        2. clitellata:
            - oligochaeta ("few hairs"): earthworms (25:30)
                - terrestrial & few aquatic
                    - ~10k species
                    - no parapodia, few setae (bristle structures)
                    - light sensitive cells (also able to sense vibrations)
                - detritivores
                - hermaphroditic: clitellum (swollen section) secretes cocoon for embryo development (no specialized larval stage)
                    - clitellum suggests close relationship to leeches
            - hirudinea: leeches
                - mainly freshwater
                - ectoparasitic & carnivorous
                - no setae
                - anterior & posterior suckers
                    - attaches onto host using anterior suckers when feeding & injects hirudin (chemical in saliva) into bloodstream of host
                - hermaphroditic: clitellum secretes cocoon for embryo development (no specialized larval stage)
                - medicinal uses: 
                    - hirudin (anticoagulant properties)
                    - used to inc bloodflow for reattached limbs
                    - often best option for safely removing excess blood from wound (acts as artificial vein until patient grows back capillaries to inc local circ)
                - example: leech (hirudo medicinalis)
        3. echiura & sipuncula: unsegmented worms (NOT COVERED)
            - recent molecular data groups echiura & sipuncula in anelida (ancestors were segmented & later lost segmentation)

mollusks:
    - general facts:
        - >85k extant species
        - 2nd largest animal group (after arthropods)
        - terrestrial or aquatic
        - higly diverse:
            - morphology
            - modes of nutrition
            - reproduction
            - response to env
        - bilateral symmetry, triploblastic, protosomes
        - reduced (but true) coelom (mainly encloses heart & gonad), replaced by hemocoel (open circ)
        - have trochophore larvae
        - major groups are modifications on ancestral body plan
    - mollusk body plan:
        1. foot: used for movement & acts as hydrostatic skeleton
        2. mantle: outgrowth of body wall that covers visceral mass forming enclosure called mantle cavity 
            - mantle cavity contains gills (aquatic) & acts as lung (terrestrial)
            - mantle of many species secretes hard shell of calcium carbonate
        3. visceral mass: contains most main internal organs (heart, stomach, nephridia, gonads)
        - have specialized anatomical structure: radula - used to scrape food off hard surfaces, equipped w/ tiny teeth & is right next to mouth
        - have distinct heart, stomach & digestive gland
        - modifications of ancestral molluskan body-plan: allows diversification of mollusks to 4 major mollusk classes
    - 4 major mollusk classes:
        1. polyplacophora: "bearer of many plates"
            - segmented shell (8 overlapping plates): somewhat pliable/flexible
                - slightly overlapped at back & front yet well coordinated (provides protection while being able to flex) 
            - most primitive group of mollusks
            - grazing herbivors: radula scrapes algae & bryozoans
            - separate sexes, external fertilization: trochophore larva
            - example: chitons
                - ~1k extant species common to intertidal zones (but also deep oceans)
                    - inhabit hard surfaces under rocks (in crevices) in cold water to tropics  
                - large muscular foot: considerable suction/adhesion power
                - ability to roll into ball
                - distinct rows of gills located/protected in mantle grooves
        2. bivalvia: "two valves"
            - morphology:
                - name due to 2 hinged shells
                - some able to move around, other cannot & burrow themselves in sediment
                - reduction of head & no radula
                - enlargement of foot: can be modified to become powerful digging tool in some groups (particularly burrowing forms)
                    - foot can also be reduced in free-living forms like oysters 
                - enlargement of gills (since they are filter feeders)
                - mantle cavity modified by siphons  w/ inhaling & exhaling opening
                    - siphons: formed as extensions of posterior mantle
                    - creates strong water current in mantle cavity & across gills that act as filters for food
                    - single oyster can filter 200L of water/day
            - relatively sessile
            - filter/suspension feeders: no radula
            - either dioecious or germaphroditic: brodcast spawners or external fertilization (trochophore larvae)
            - example: family of scallops
                - large adductor muscles to close shell: able to perform rapid movements across short distances (appears to fly in water)
                    - can escape predation by tightly closing shell to protect soft internal parts
                - mantle lined with eyes: can detect motion & light
        3. gastropoda: "belly feet"
            - most diverse group of mollusks (~70k species)
            - inhabit terrestrial or aquatic envs (both marine & freshwater)
            - shelled (snails) or shell-less (slugs, nudibranchs)
            - herbivores, predators, scavengers
            - more complex head & eyes
            - well developed radula
            - reproduction:
                - sexual or asexual (by parthenogenesis)
                - internal (terrestrial) or external (aquatic) fertilization
                - either dioecious or hermaphroditic (produce veliger larvae after early trochophore stage in aquatic forms)
            - gastropod body plan:
                - strong torsion/twisting of body (some sinistral (clockwise twist, rise to left), some dextral (counterclockwise twist, lean to right)):
                    - 180 deg rotation/ of visceral mass (and visible as shell)
                    - twisting results in mantle cavity & anus moved over head
                - coiling of visceral mass
            - example: family pumonata ("land snails")
                - loss of gills with with mantle cavity modified to pallial (mantle) lung (highly vascularized): well adapted to life away from water 
                - eyes on tips of tentacles
                - detritivores & lay eggs in soil
                - important food source for other wildlife: important trophic link
            - example: nudibranchs ("naked gill")
                - no shell & no torsion: gills on outside & secondary de-torsion
                - bright colours warn potential predators of toxins: some are poisonous, others merely adopt colours of poisonous relatives
                    - generally carnivorous: some prey on tentacles of cnidarians & re-use cnidocytes
        4. cephalopoda: "head foot"
            - morphology: 
            - ~800 species
            - body plan is most transformed of all mollusks
            - characteristics:
                - forms:
                    1. decapodiforms: 8 arms, 2 tentacles - most squids & cuttlefish
                    2. octopodiforms: 8 arms, no tentacles - most octopuses
                - morphological features:
                    - subdivided foot -> arms & tentacles
                        - arms & tentacles equipped with suckers &/ hooks
                    - enlarged head with reduced shell (internal shell)
                    - powerful radula for crushing prey
                    - uses strong muscles to compress mantle cavity to create strong jet out of siphon for locomotion/propulsion
                    - siphon also used to expel waste
                    - very versatile predators with excellent vision (complex eyes with lens)
                    - complex behaviour: most evolved invertebrates (known to be true problem solvers)
                        - visual communication with colour & texture (chromatophores for colour, photophores for bioluminescence)
                        - cryptic coloration (masters of disguise)
                    - bladder-like ink sac that can suddenly release ink to create smoke effect to esape predation
                - reproduction:
                    - separate sexes with elaborate courtship
                    - internal fertilization (NO TROCHOPHORE LARVA): males transfer sperm via specialized arm (hectocotylus)
                    - females die after laying eggs (or after eggs hatch)
                        - thus, fisheries only take pre-reproductive cephalopods which have huge impact on populations
                - many are short-lived: complete life cycle in less than a year
            - example: nautilus
                - 80-90 arms 
                - only extant SOLID SHELLED CEPHALOPOD (beautiful ornamented outside shell)
                - regulate buoyancy with gases in internal chambers/compartments within shell
                - not fast swimmers: lives in deep sea
                - matures in 20 years & deposits fewer eggs than its relatives
                - harvested for ornamental value
    - other mollusk classes:
        - ammonoidea (ammonites): extinct genus of mollusks
            - very little is known about their lifestyle: soft bodies are rarely preserved 
            - dominant invertebrate predator (300 Mya)
            - extinct at end of Cretaceous (65 Mya)
            - not closely related to nautilus despite close resemblance of shell
    - mollusks & humans:
        - economy & culture: often overharvested
            - food (shellfish)
            - jewelry (pearls, abalone)
        - ecology:
            - vectors for parasites (intermediate hosts)
            - exotic invasions: invasive species such as zebra mussel
        - neurobiological research on squid neurons: (very giant neurons)
            - squid giant axon can be up to 1.5mm in diameter & up to 10m long 



EXAM: SUPPLEMENT ONLY
    - 4 advantages of segmentation:
        1. multiple copies of organs, structures (ex. nephridia, parapodia)
        2. efficient nervous control
            - ganglion in each segment
            - faster responses
            - efficient localized movement
        3. inc body size by unit repetition
        4. regeneration: ability to regenerate even the head region!! (more segments lost -> more difficult to regen head)
    - 4 advantages of closed circ sys: blood contained within vessels at all times
        1. improved exchange between deeper tissues & surface (O2, CO2)
        2. faster transport of nutrients & gases
        3. requires less energy for distribution
        4. allows development of thicker body (free of diffusion limit from body wall)
    - 3 parts of mollusk body plan:
        1. foot: used for movement & acts as hydrostatic skeleton
        2. mantle: outgrowth of body wall that covers visceral mass forming enclosure called mantle cavity 
            - mantle cavity contains gills (aquatic) & acts as lung (terrestrial)
            - mantle of many species secretes hard shell of calcium carbonate
        3. visceral mass: contains most main internal organs (heart, stomach, nephridia, gonads)
        - have specialized anatomical structure: radula - used to scrape food off hard surfaces, equipped w/ tiny teeth & is right next to mouth
        - have distinct heart, stomach & digestive gland
        - modifications of ancestral molluskan body-plan: allows diversification of mollusks to 4 major mollusk classes
