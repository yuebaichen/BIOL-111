L16 - 4.3: inverts 3 - cnidarians & platyhelminthes: evolution of body cavity
    
cnidarians: diploblastic, radially symmetrical, blind gut
    - general facts:
        - jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, hydrozoans
        - ~11k species
            - most marine with few freshwater relatives
            - habitat ranges from surface to benthic (seabed substrates) habitats
            - vary greatly in size: microscopic to may meters long
        - diploblastic (with 2 embryonic layers)
        - primitive nervous system & muscular tissue
            - nervous system consists of net of nerves with no ganglia or brain (typical to radially symmetrical organisms)
            - organisms with radial symmetry have equal chance of encountering prey from any direction: simple nerve net
                - organisms have a diffused nervous system like a net
                - capable of efficiently receiving & sending signals in any direction
                - no concentration/integration of nerves since sensory info can come from any direction
    - generalized body plan of cnidarian: typical diploblastic organization
        - mouth/anus: from blastopore (first opening)
        - gastrovascular cavity ("blind gut"): from archenteron
            - single opening for ingestion of food & elimination of waste
        - 3 major layers:
            - gastrodermis (inner layer): from endoderm
            - epidermis (outer layer): from ectoderm
            - mesoglea (gelatinous layer between gastro & epi dermis): consists of collagen & proteoglycans
                - sometimes gives organisms a transparent body/appearance
        - most body plans have radial symmetry & consist of the 3 major layers
    - 2 body forms/orientations: both are capable of movement via muscle contraction
        - polyp (sessile): mouth/anus facing up
            - sea anemone: trunk covered by oral disk with tentacles surrounding a central mouth
        - medusa (motile): mouth/anus facing down
            - jellyfish: free-floating planktonic form
    - most life cycles of cnidarians:
        - include both polyp form (typically asexual stage) & medusa form (sexual stage)
        - exceptions: sea anemones, corals (no medusa stage, polyp produces gametes)
    - how cnidarians obtain energy:
        - key characteristic of cnidarians is presence of cnidocytes: specialized cell used for capturing prey
            - cnidocytes commonly located near mouth or in tentacles as part of epidermis
        - cnidarians are carnivorous: 
            - when cnidocyte senses prey, it rapid ejects nematocyst (spear-like structure) equipped with barbs & contains toxins
            - barb holds prey in place while toxins subdue prey -> prey is ingested
            - extracellular digestion in gastrovascular cavity
            - corals & anemones can obtain large part of their energy (up to 80%) from symbiotic algae (dinoflagellates) capable of photosynthesis
    - 4 major groups of cnidarians: diversity
        - hydrozoa: hydra (freshwater species)
            - hydra: one of the best studied organisms (well-known)
                - freshwater species
                - persists as polyp with no medusa stage
                - moves by gliding/somersaulting/floating
                - 2-5mm in size
                - has bubble at basal disk allowing hydra to control bouyancy
                - small but voracious (wanting to devour great quantities of food): can devour huge daphnia relative to hydra size
                - spends a lot of time sustained on substrate but is also capable of movement (but still is still polyp)
            - genus Obelia: consists of mainly marine hydrozoan species but also consists of some freshwater species as well
                - has body polyp & medusa stages
                - life cycle of Obelia:
                    - colonies attached to hard substrate or seaweed contains asexual reproductive polyps 
                    - budding polyps releases medusa
                    - medusa produces haploid gametes & fertilization happens in open ocean
                    - zygote forms mobile ciliated larva that eventually settles to substrate to form new colony
                - portuguese man-of-war:
                    - inhabits tropical/subtropical oceans
                    - consists of colonial polyps specialized for different functions:
                        - gonozooids: reproduction
                        - gastrozooids & dactylozooids: specialized for feeding
                    - tentacles contain stinging cnidocytes
                    - entire colony supported by gas-filled float: pneumatophore
                    - tentacles can reach up to 50m long
        - scyphozoa: true jellyfish (most are pelagic, roam in open ocean)
            - general facts:
                - ~200 species
                - characterized by thick mesoglea
                - have typical bell shape with arms around mouth and tentacles & sensory cells at edge of bell
                - tentacles & oral arms are equipped with nematocysts (some strong enough to be felt by humans)
                - prey on fish larvae & zooplankton
                - important food for leatherback turtles
            - example: cassiopeia
                - non-pelagic: lies at botton of shallow waters with mouth & tentacles oriented upwards
                - mouth is reduced & barely used
                - obtains most of energy from symbiotic algae (dinoflagellates) in tentacles & gelatinous body
                - gets oxygen & nutrients from symbionts
                - lives in mangrove swamps
        - cubozoa: box jellyfish
            - known for cube shape medusa form & powerful stings (produce very potent toxins)
            - found in tropical & subtropical waters
            - classification of jellyfish:
                - cubozoans were classified under one order scyphoszoa until 1973
                    - no solid evidence from molecular data, just morphological differences
                - cubozoans have more developed nervous system
                - cubozoans display complex behaviours such as obstacle avoidance & fast directional swimming
                - cubozoans have image forming eyes with light & movement perception
                - cubozoans have distinct life cycle with planula (flat, ciliated, free-swimming) larva growing into a polyp that develops into a single medusa without budding
        - anthozoa: true corals, sea anemones, sea fans, sea pens (flower animals)
            - ~6k species 
            - have no medusa stage: larvae develop directly into polyp
            - example: sea anemones
                - tentacles can be retracted for defence or expanded to catch passing prey
                - tentacles armed with cnidocytes
                - predatory animals
                - have interesting mutualistic relationships particularly with fish & shrimp species
                    - clown fish secretes mucus for immunity to stings
                        - clown fish drives off intruders & removes parasites in exchange for safety & food scraps
            - example: corals
                - form colonies of myriad (large number) of genetically identical polyps
                - secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become framework of coral reefs
                - have mutualistic relationship with dinoflagellates (zooxanthelae)
                    - coral provides protected env with basic compounds for photosynthesis
                    - dinoflagellates provide oxygen, nutrients, and helps remove waste 
                    - algal cells need light for photosynthesis (clear water with little suspended substrate): thus corals are only found in clear waters
                - coral bleaching:
                    - serious recent ecological problem where zooxanthelae are expelled (thus change in color of coral)
                    - stress response due to variety of factors:    
                        - inc water temp
                        - inc uv radiation
                        - pollution
                        - disease (bacteria)
                    - coral dies if algae aren't reabsorbed fast enough since coral gets most of energy from symbionts
                    - bleaching events can be extensive & extremely damaging
                        - reef can turn from coral dominated to algal dominated in just a few months (could take decades to reverse)
                        - galapagos islands was one of first documented events of mass bleaching & coral mortality:
                            - reef lost 95% of coral in 1982
                            - ability to recover depends on health of coral before event (low fishing & pollution)
                            - addition of multiple stressors can cause synergistic effect 
                - provide shelter for 25% of marine species despite only covering 0.1% of ocean floor
                - incredibly important to protect shorelines, support fisheries, & provide tourist attraction

features of triploblastic organisms: focus on coelom
    - body plans with respect to body cavities (coelom): coelomates, pseudocoelomates, acoelomates
        - coelom is key evolutionary innovation since cavities filled with fluids could act as hydrostatic skeleton (NOT DIGESTIVE CAVITY)
            - space for circulation of oxygen & nutrients and for protection of internal organs 
        - 3 types of body plans with respect to body cavities in TRIPLOBLASTIC organisms:
            - coelomates: true coelomic cavity
                - have enclosed body cavity
                - mesoderm lines entire body cabity as a "peritoneum"
                - found in most triploblasts: annelids, mollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, chordates
                - anatomy:
                    - skin: from ectoderm
                    - muscles & organs: from mesoderm (contains coelom)
                    - gut (internal organ): from endoderm
            - pseudocoelomates: false coelom
                - mesoderm only lines outside of pseudocoel
                - examples: nematoda, rotifera
            - acoelomates: no body cavity
                - lack a fluid-filled cavity between body wall & digestive tract
                - completely solid except digestive space
                - still triploblastic (just no coelom)
                - example: flatworm (LOST THEIR coelom)
        - 2 major ways to make a coelom:
            - schizocoely: splitting within mesoderm -> protostomes
            - enterocoely: mesoderm forms pockets from gut -> deuterostomes
            - differences between protostome & deuterostome:
                - protostome: 
                    - cleavage: spiral
                    - coelom formation: splitting within mesoderm
                    - origin of mouth & anus: blastopore develops into mouth, anus forms later
                - deuterostome:
                    - cleavage: radial
                    - coelom formation: mesoderm forms pockets from gut
                    - origin of mouth & anus: blastopore develops into anus, mouth forms later
    - cephalization: linked directly to movement
        - concentration of neurons & sensory organs at anterior end of organism (forming head/brain): sense organs probe env & enables direct locomotion
        - associated with bilateral symmetry
        - sensory structures: mechanoreceptors (touch), chemoreceptors (taste/smell), photoreceptors (light)

platyhelminthes (flatworms): triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, acoelomates
    - general facts:
        - ~25k species (diverse)
        - inhabit moist aquatic or terrestrial envs
            - no coelom so gas exchange is conducted through body wall hence moist habitat
        - "free-living" scavengers or parasitic (endo or ecto parasites)
        - range from 1mm to 10m!!!
        - have a blind gut (one opening for both ingestion of food & elimination of waste)
    - characteristics:
        - absence of many typical animal traits confused biologists regarding phylogenetic position: no coelom, gas exchange through body wall
            - however, molecular data confirms placement of flatworms into the clade Lophotrochozoa (flatworms had loss of traits)
        - equally closely related to annelids & mollusks
        - are protostomes: blastopore develops into mouth, are triplobastic
        - acoelomates (no body cavity)
        - flatworms show signs of cephalization (concentration of sense organs & ganglia)
            - however, flatworms still have simple nervous system:
                - 2 cerebral ganglia (simple bundle of nerves): concentration of neurons, "primitive brain"
                - 2 longitudinal nerve chords, one on either side of body
    - diversity of platyhelminthes (flatworms): 4 major groups/classes
        - free living:
            - turbellaria: planarians (free-living, mostly aquatic, mostly marine, some freshwater)
                - hunt for protists or small animals
                - have blind digestive tube with opening near middle of ventral (belly) surface 
                - have amazing ability to regenerate body
                    - used for model to study stem cells & differentiated cells in adults
                    - appears to be due to presence of adult somatic stem cells (making up 30% of cells in adult body)
                - anterior end will always develop into head resulting from molecular gradient along body
                - reproduce asexually by fission & sexually (mostly hermaphroditic, both male & female gonads present on single individual)
                - example: spanish dancer
        - parasitic:
            - monogenea: flukes (mostly ectoparasitic)
                - flukes: flat body with suckers
                - important ectoparasites on fish, frogs, reptiles, cephalopods
                    - some species are endoparasites
                - do not require intermediate hosts: can self attach using characteristic attachments (organs equipped with hooks/clamps)
            - trematoda: flukes (mostly endoparasitic)
                - responsible for well known disease Schistosomiasis:
                    - caused by parasitic trematodes called schistosomes
                    - common in asia, afria, south america
                    - disease rarely causes death but can damage internal organs & impair groth & development in children
                    - life cycle of schistosomes:
                        - mature flukes in blood vessels of intestine of primary host (definitive vertebrate host like humans)
                        - reproduce sexually in human host
                        - fertilized eggs exit host in feces
                        - eggs develop in water into ciliated larvae
                        - larvae infect snail host
                            - intermediate host: shorter transitional stage
                        - asexual reproduction in snail -> another type of motile larva (cercaria)
                        - larvae penetrate skin & blood vessels of humans
                            - primary host: organism reaches maturity & sexual reproduction
            - cestoda: flukes (endoparasitic)
                - inhabit intestines of vertebrates (obligate parasites, depends completely on host)
                - generally primary host is vertebrate & intermediate host is invertebrate (such as insect, crustacean, mollusk, annelid) but can also be another vertebrate
                - are host-specific (adapted to certain species or group of hosts)
                - adaptations:
                    - scolex: suckers, hooks
                    - proglottids: reproductive segments containing a set of both male and female gonads
                        - protective cuticle forms around embryos -> terminal proglottids break off -> passed via feces
                        - are essentially hermaphroditic egg producing machines with ability to possibly self-fertilize
                    - specialized epidermis for nutrient absorption
                        - no mouth, no digestive system

                    - have typical bell shape with arms around mouth and tentacles & sensory cells at edge of bell
                    - tentacles & oral arms are equipped with nematocysts (some strong enough to be felt by humans)
                    - prey on fish larvae & zooplankton
                    - important food for leatherback turtles
                - example: cassiopeia
                    - non-pelagic: lies at botton of shallow waters with mouth & tentacles oriented upwards
                    - mouth is reduced & barely used
                    - obtains most of energy from symbiotic algae (dinoflagellates) in tentacles & gelatinous body
                    - gets oxygen & nutrients from symbionts
                    - lives in mangrove swamps
            - cubozoa: box jellyfish
                - known for cube shape medusa form & powerful stings (produce very potent toxins)
                - found in tropical & subtropical waters
                - classification of jellyfish:
                    - cubozoans were classified under one order scyphoszoa until 1973
                        - no solid evidence from molecular data, just morphological differences
                    - cubozoans have more developed nervous system
                    - cubozoans display complex behaviours such as obstacle avoidance & fast directional swimming
                    - cubozoans have image forming eyes with light & movement perception
                    - cubozoans have distinct life cycle with planula (flat, ciliated, free-swimming) larva growing into a polyp that develops into a single medusa without budding
            - anthozoa: true corals, sea anemones, sea fans, sea pens (flower animals)
                - ~6k species 
                - have no medusa stage: larvae develop directly into polyp
                - example: sea anemones
                    - tentacles can be retracted for defence or expanded to catch passing prey
                    - tentacles armed with cnidocytes
                    - predatory animals
                    - have interesting mutualistic relationships particularly with fish & shrimp species
                        - clown fish secretes mucus for immunity to stings
                            - clown fish drives off intruders & removes parasites in exchange for safety & food scraps
                - example: corals
                    - form colonies of myriad (large number) of genetically identical polyps
                    - secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become framework of coral reefs
                    - have mutualistic relationship with dinoflagellates (zooxanthelae)
                        - coral provides protected env with basic compounds for photosynthesis
                        - dinoflagellates provide oxygen, nutrients, and helps remove waste 
                        - algal cells need light for photosynthesis (clear water with little suspended substrate): thus corals are only found in clear waters
                    - coral bleaching:
                        - serious recent ecological problem where zooxanthelae are expelled (thus change in color of coral)
                        - stress response due to variety of factors:    
                            - inc water temp
                            - inc uv radiation
                            - pollution
                            - disease (bacteria)
                        - coral dies if algae aren't reabsorbed fast enough since coral gets most of energy from symbionts
                        - bleaching events can be extensive & extremely damaging
                            - reef can turn from coral dominated to algal dominated in just a few months (could take decades to reverse)
                            - galapagos islands was one of first documented events of mass bleaching & coral mortality:
                                - reef lost 95% of coral in 1982
                                - ability to recover depends on health of coral before event (low fishing & pollution)
                                - addition of multiple stressors can cause synergistic effect 
                    - provide shelter for 25% of marine species despite only covering 0.1% of ocean floor
                    - incredibly important to protect shorelines, support fisheries, & provide tourist attraction

    - features of triploblastic organisms: focus on coelom
        - body plans with respect to body cavities (coelom): coelomates, pseudocoelomates, acoelomates
            - coelom is key evolutionary innovation since cavities filled with fluids could act as hydrostatic skeleton (NOT DIGESTIVE CAVITY)
                - space for circulation of oxygen & nutrients and for protection of internal organs 
            - 3 types of body plans with respect to body cavities in TRIPLOBLASTIC organisms:
                - coelomates: true coelomic cavity
                    - have enclosed body cavity
                    - mesoderm lines entire body cabity as a "peritoneum"
                    - found in most triploblasts: annelids, mollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, chordates
                    - anatomy:
                        - skin: from ectoderm
                        - muscles & organs: from mesoderm (contains coelom)
                        - gut (internal organ): from endoderm
                - pseudocoelomates: false coelom
                    - mesoderm only lines outside of pseudocoel
                    - examples: nematoda, rotifera
                - acoelomates: no body cavity
                    - lack a fluid-filled cavity between body wall & digestive tract
                    - completely solid except digestive space
                    - still triploblastic (just no coelom)
                    - example: flatworm (LOST THEIR coelom)
            - 2 major ways to make a coelom:
                - schizocoely: splitting within mesoderm -> protostomes
                - enterocoely: mesoderm forms pockets from gut -> deuterostomes
                - differences between protostome & deuterostome:
                    - protostome: 
                        - cleavage: spiral
                        - coelom formation: splitting within mesoderm
                        - origin of mouth & anus: blastopore develops into mouth, anus forms later
                    - deuterostome:
                        - cleavage: radial
                        - coelom formation: mesoderm forms pockets from gut
                        - origin of mouth & anus: blastopore develops into anus, mouth forms later
        - cephalization: linked directly to movement
            - concentration of neurons & sensory organs at anterior end of organism (forming head/brain): sense organs probe env & enables direct locomotion
            - associated with bilateral symmetry
            - sensory structures: mechanoreceptors (touch), chemoreceptors (taste/smell), photoreceptors (light)

    - platyhelminthes (flatworms): triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, acoelomates (range from 1mm - 10m!!)
        - ~25k species (diverse), inhabit moist aquatic or terrestrial envs (no coelom so gas exchange is conducted through body wall hence moist habitat)
        - characteristics:
            - absence of many typical animal traits confused biologists regarding phylogenetic position: no coelom, gas exchange through body wall
                - however, molecular data confirms placement of flatworms into the clade Lophotrochozoa (flatworms had loss of traits)
            - equally closely related to annelids & mollusks
            - are protostomes: blastopore develops into mouth, are triplobastic
            - acoelomates (no body cavity)
            - have a blind gut (one opening for both ingestion of food & elimination of waste)
            - flatworms show signs of cephalization (concentration of sense organs & ganglia)
                - however, flatworms still have simple nervous system:
                    - 2 cerebral ganglia (simple bundle of nerves): concentration of neurons, "primitive brain"
                    - 2 longitudinal nerve chords, one on either side of body
        - diversity of platyhelminthes (flatworms): 4 major groups/classes
            - free living:
                - turbellaria: planarians (free-living, mostly aquatic, mostly marine, some freshwater)
                    - hunt for protists or small animals
                    - have blind digestive tube with opening near middle of ventral (belly) surface 
                    - have amazing ability to regenerate body
                        - used for model to study stem cells & differentiated cells in adults
                        - appears to be due to presence of adult somatic stem cells (making up 30% of cells in adult body)
                    - anterior end will always develop into head resulting from molecular gradient along body
                    - reproduce asexually by fission & sexually (mostly hermaphroditic, both male & female gonads present on single individual)
                    - example: spanish dancer
            - parasitic:
                - monogenea: flukes (mostly ectoparasitic)
                    - flukes: flat body with suckers
                    - important ectoparasites on fish, frogs, reptiles, cephalopods
                        - some species are endoparasites
                    - do not require intermediate hosts: can self attach using characteristic attachments (organs equipped with hooks/clamps)
                - trematoda: flukes (mostly endoparasitic)
                    - responsible for well known disease Schistosomiasis:
                        - caused by parasitic trematodes called schistosomes
                        - common in asia, afria, south america
                        - disease rarely causes death but can damage internal organs & impair groth & development in children
                        - life cycle of schistosomes:
                            - mature flukes in blood vessels of intestine of primary host (definitive vertebrate host like humans)
                            - reproduce sexually in human host
                            - fertilized eggs exit host in feces
                            - eggs develop in water into ciliated larvae
                            - larvae infect snail host
                                - intermediate host: shorter transitional stage
                            - asexual reproduction in snail -> another type of motile larva (cercaria)
                            - larvae penetrate skin & blood vessels of humans
                                - primary host: organism reaches maturity & sexual reproduction
                - cestoda: flukes (endoparasitic)
                    - inhabit intestines of vertebrates (obligate parasites, depends completely on host)
                    - generally primary host is vertebrate & intermediate host is invertebrate (such as insect, crustacean, mollusk, annelid) but can also be another vertebrate
                    - are host-specific (adapted to certain species or group of hosts)
                    - adaptations:
                        - scolex: suckers, hooks
                        - proglottids: reproductive segments containing a set of both male and female gonads
                            - protective cuticle forms around embryos -> terminal proglottids break off -> passed via feces
                            - are essentially hermaphroditic egg producing machines with ability to possibly self-fertilize
                        - specialized epidermis for nutrient absorption
                            - no mouth, no digestive system
