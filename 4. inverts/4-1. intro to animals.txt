L14 - 4.1: inverts 1 - intro to animals: what is an animal?

7 characteristics of animals:
    1. eukaryotic (domain eukarya):
        - similar to fungi, ciliates, plants
        - have a "true" nucleus
        - well-compartmentalized & specialized membrane-bound organelles
        - compartmentalized cytoplasm
    2. heterotrophic:
        - all animals consume/use pre-formed organic materials as energy & carbon source
        - facilitate flow of energy & carbon through trophic chain via consumption
        - modes of feeding:
            - predation
            - herbivory
            - filter feeding
            - parasitism
            - detritivory
            - omnivory
        - digestion occurs in specialized organs (not through absorption)
        - heterotrophism is not unique to animals: plants, fungi, protists, prokaryotes can all be heterotrophism
    3. multicellularity:
        - all animals are multicellular (similar to plants & fungi)
        - multicellularity evolved several times in groups such as fungi or algae but only once in animals
        - implications of having multiple cells:
            - cells can become specialized to carry out specific functions
            - organisms can have longer lifespan
            - organisms can grow in size (can maintain high SA to volume ratio while still growing in size)
                - SA to volume ratio decreases drastically as cell size increases
                - imperative to keep cell size small for high exchange efficiency out of cell
                - ratio determines nutrient intake & waste expulsion
        - most animals have tissues:
            - tissues: groups of similar cells organized into a functional unit
            - 4 types of animal tissues:
                - muscle tissue: active contractile tissue
                - nervous tissue: comprises the nervous system
                - connective tissue: non-living tissue forming extracellular matrix
                - epithelial tissue: cells covering organ surfaces
            - animals have organs that comprises of different types of tissue to complete complex tasks (absorption, digestion)
                - example: villi projections in small intestine contain all 4 types of animal tissue & massively inc SA for absorption
    4. no cell wall:
        - types of extracellular forms of support:
            - hydrostatic skeleton: 
                - found in soft-bodied organisms: muscles contract against fluid-filled cavity
                - longitudinal & circular muscles contract to provide structure & change shape (fluids are resistant to volume change)
                - pros & cons of hydrostatic skeletons:
                    - organisms can perform simple but efficient movements
                    - limited possibility for attachment of limbs
                    - dependence of wet/humid environment (to maintain fluid filled cavity)
                - examples: cnidarians, worms, shell-less mollusks
            - exoskeleton: external skeleton
                - firm, rigid, non-living structures outside the body that act as an external armour
                - does not allow for animals to grow in linear fashion since shell does not grow with animal
                - undergo molting: shedding of exoskeletons 
                - called ecdysozoans (molting animals) since they grow by ecdysis (molting)
                - examples: shelled mollusks, arthropods
            - endoskeleton:
                - rigid structure inside the body that provides internal support
                - consists of all vertebrates (living endoskeleton) & some invertebrates (non-living endoskeleton)
                - examples: sponges, echinoderms, vertebrates
                    - cuttlebone in cuttlefish: internal shell filled with gas for bouyancy (studied for light, porous, yet mechanically resistant structure)
    5. motile at some life stage:
        - movement reduces competition, enhances genetic diversity, expands distribution range, etc
            - barnacles: although adults are sessile, larvae are motile
    6. diploid somatic (body) cells:
        - somatic cells have two copies of each type of chromosome (one from mother, one from father)
    7. diplontic:
        - diploid stage is dominant over haploid & characterizes most of life of individual
        - whereas fungi is haplontic, plants are alternating, animals are diploid most of the time
        - haploid stage is very ephermal: only involves formation of gametes (exception: male honey bees are haploid)

evolution of animals:
    - facts:
        - ~35 phyla
        - estimated ~10 mil animal species
        - only ~1.4 mil species have been classified
        - 97% of animal species are invertebrates
    - 4 key evolutions in animal phylogeny:
        1. multicellularity -> sponges
        2. 2 embryonic layers -> cnidarians
        3. 3 embryonic layers, bilateral symmetry -> acoelomorpha
        4. coelom, CNS, cephalization -> protostomes, deuterostomes
            - protostomes: Lophotrochozoa, Ecdysozoa
            - deuterostomes: Echinodermata, Chordata (INCLUDES VERTEBRATES)
    - history of life:
        - life forms were unicellular for almost 3 billion years
        - first animals (early sponges) evolved in the late precambrian era (700 Mya)
        - followed by the most explosive wave of diversification: The Cambrian Explosion (542-488 Mya)
            - called Cambrian Explosion since it marks period when most major groups of animals first appear in fossil record
            - rapid diversification with formation of many new phyla
            - well documented in two fossil records:
                - XinJiang, China
                - Burgess Shale, BC
        - earliest fossils precambrian were tiny micro-fossils of sponges & corals
        - fossils are infamously difficult to classify (palaeontologists looking at organisms upside down)
        - animals evolved in the ocean then several lineages independently colonize land
    - animals are monophyletic: contains all descendents/lineages of common ancestor
        - animals share many characteristics
        - although most of their characteristics are shared with some other groups, no other group shares all of them

3 other lines of evidence that animals are monophyletic:
    1. similar gene sequences & genomic architecture:
        - hox genes (subset of homeobox genes):
            - genes that act in development & control/specify identity of diff body parts along head-tail axis
            - evolved in a process of tandem gene duplication
                - first identified in segmented animals then in non-segmented animals
            - organization of hox genes in chromosome are same as their order of expression (spacial collinearity):
                - collinearity: correspondence between order of location & order of function
                - collinearity provides clear link between genome organiation & regulation of genes during development
                - distinct changes to order of hox genes makes important evolutionary transitions
    - similar ways to form well integrated tissues: 
        2. similar extracellular matrix molecules:
            - most animals secrete an extracellular matrix which provides some level of structural support & controls communication among cells 
            - similar to cell wall of plant cell but contains more protein than carbs
            - contains collagen fibres: most common protein (30% of mammal proteins)
            - proteoglycan complex (surrounds cable-like collagen): proteins that are heavily glycosylated (carb is attach to hydroxyl or other functional group)
        3. unique types of junctions among cells:
            - 3 types of junctions: do not necessarily coexist in an actual cell
                - tight junction: 
                    - seal cells together & are found in epithelial tissue lining stomach & intestine
                    - involves specialized proteins in the cell membrane & form a watertight seal
                - desmosome:
                    - connect the cytoskeleton of cells & are abundant in epithelial tissue
                    - follow a continuous structure; running between all cells in the tissue 
                    - common in epithelial tissue
                - gap junction:
                    - act as channels between cells
                    - found in some muscle & nerve tissues where rapid communication between cells is important

                - similar to cell wall of plant cell but w/ more protein than carbs
                - contains collagen fibres (most common protein, 30% of mammal proteins): proteoglycan complex surrounds collagen (heavily glycosated proteins)
            3. shared unique types of junctions among cells: 3 junction types
                1. tight junction: seals cells tgt, found in epithelial tissue lining stomach & intestine, involves specialized proteins in cell membrane, forms watertight seal
                2. desmosome: connect cytoskeleton of cells, abundant in epithelial tissue, follows a continuous structure running btwn all cells in tissue
                3. gap junction: act as channels btwn cells (found in some muscle & nerve tissues where rapid communication is important)
