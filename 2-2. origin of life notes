    -*) ^#central dogma: explanation of flow of genetic information within a biological system

2. #^ribosome {6}: macromolecular translation machine consisting of a complex of RNA&protein that perform biological protein synthesis (mRNA translation)
    (1-> RNA polymerase synthesizes a single mRNA molecule from one strand (“antisense” strand) of DNA, producing a working copy of the “sense” strand
        ((1-> #^RNA: polymeric molecule (nucleic acid) essential for most biological functions, either by performing the function itself (non-coding RNA) or by forming a template for production of proteins (messenger RNA)^#
            -*) #^tRNA: adaptor molecule composed of RNA that serves as the physical link between the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins^#
        ((2-> #^polymerase: enzyme that synthesizes long chains of polymers or nucleic acids (used to assembled DNA or RNA)^#
        ((3-> #^sense strand: (coding strand) DNA strand that carries the code to make a protein; has same base sequence as mRNA except for thymine instead of uracil^#
        ((4-> #^antisense strand: (non-coding strand) DNA strand that serves as a template during transcription; read in the opposite direction of sense strand^#
            -*) sense and antisense DNA are two complementary strands of DNA that have opposite orientations and sequences
    (2-> transcription stops when a termination sequence is encountered
    (3-> ~10k ribosomes in a fast-growing bacteria cell; only 10-100 in a slow growing cell
    (4-> ~1-15 copies of ribosomal genes in a bacterial genome
    (5-> ribosomes consists of 2 subunits {2}:
        -1) small 30S subunit (contains 16S rRNA): reads the mRNA
        -2) large 50S subunit (contains 5S and 23S rRNA): forms polypeptide chains of amino acids
    (6-> steps of ribosome translation {6}:
        -1) ribosome forms by locking a larger onto a smaller subunit; docks on the start codon of an mRNA molecule in the cytoplasm
        -2) tRNA molecules bearing amino acids are distinguished by a triplet recognition sequence of 3 nucleotides; each docks at the corresponding triplet nucleotide sequence of the mRNA molecule
        -3) ribosome moves along one codon notch on the mRNA molecule and receives a new tRNA molecule loaded with its amino acid
        -4) formation of a peptide bond attaches the new amino acid to the previous one
        -5) successive tRNAs donate amino acids to the elongation protein, which extends into the cytoplasm
        -6) end of nRNA molecule is marked by a stop codon (AUU); ribosome disengages and separates into two subunits; protein folds up and diffuses away

redundancy of genetic code
- lots of codons code for the same thing
- (# of amino acids to be specified) < (# of different nucleotides in mRNA)(# of nucleotides per codon)
    - why amino acids?
        - why only C, H, N, O, S
        - why 20?
        - two theories:
            - “frozen accident” (crick)
            - optimal biochemistry in view of versatility, cost of synthesis, etc

origins of life on earth
- timeline of life on earth:
        - 4.5 bya: origin of earth
    - 4.0-4.5 bya: heavy meteorite bombardment
        - 4.0 bya: oldest rock - acosta gneiss, NWT
    - 3.6-4.0 bya: origin of life (very little oxygen, liquid oceans, atmosphere of CO2/H2O/CH4/sulphur gases, relatively cool sun)
        - 3.8 bya: oldest sedimentary deposit - greenland
    - 3.2-3.6 bya: possible evidence of cellular organisms
        - 3.5 bya: 13/12C light carbon signature (possibly photosynthesis)
        - 3.4 bya: Warrawoona (western Australia) stromatolites
    - 2.0-3.2 bya: direct evidence of cellular organisms
        - 3.0 bya: stromatolites - Steep Rock, Ontario
        - 2.7 bya: abundant stromatolites (cyanobacteria: bacteria capable of photosynthesis)
        - 2.5 bya: fully oxidizing atmosphere
        - 2.0 bya: gunflint fossils - Ontario (abundant cellular life)
- history of life on earth:
    - mostly microbial
    - life only happened once in the universe (to our knowledge)
    - how did life evolve? most important attributes of living organisms:
        - genetic: self-replication and heritability (since these alone confer evolvability)
        - physiological: metabolism, and thus complexity
- three theories that have been advanced to explain the origin of life:
    - special creation: supernatural (not science)
    - panspermia: theory that life on earth originated from microorganisms or chemical precursors of life present in outer space and was able to initiate life upon reaching a suitable environment
    - spontaneous generation (Oparin-Haldane hypothesis): life arose gradually from inorganic molecules with “building blocks” such as amino acids arising first and then combining to make more complex polymers 
        - continuous series of entities linking the unambiguously chemical with the indisputably living, with evolution through natural selection taking over from self-assembly at some early point

panspermia
- increasing complexity (genome size) over time problem:
    - genome size doubles every ~400 million years
    - fitting a linear graph to the log transform would result in life originating before the formation of earth (however it is a big assumption to draw such a linear graph)
- undirected panspermia: dispersal of microbes from planet to planet
    - taken seriously due to short interval between appearance of permanent oceans and first signs of life
    - bacteria could be transported by meteors:
        - seems likely that some would survive atmospheric heating and impact due to evidence of living bacteria surviving in Egyptian tombs (3.5kya), Canadian permafrost (5+kya), Russian permafrost (3.5mya), amber (25-40mya), salt crystals (250mya)
    - objections to undirected panspermia:
        - low local star density
        - low probability of capture (lot of debris from mars but mars is same age as earth)
- directed panspermia: deliberate seeding of planets by aliens
    - advantage is that it incorporates an effective dispersal mechanism (except its not effective)
    - objections to directed panspermia:
        - 4by for non-intergalactic intelligent life to evolve on earth; if it took 4by elsewhere, then the total time approaches the age of the universe (only very few planets could have been seeded)
        - no convincing evidence for intelligent life anywhere else
        - why only bacteria? why not spread some more evolved form of life?
- misdirected panspermia: galactic pollution by spacecraft
    - NASA landers are sterilized to very high microbiological standards yet still has 300 spores per square meter (bacteria can survive in space - evidence found on the moon)
    - attraction of this hypothesis is that we know it could have already happened; perhaps other civilizations have been equally careless

spontaneous generation
- two chemical processes that need to happen for life to be possible:
    - growth: exergonic chemical reactions that release energy that is available for synthesizing organic molecules as the basis of metabolism
        - exergonic: metabolic/chemical process accompanied by release of energy
    - reproduction: separation of a fragment of the growing system itself capable of continued growth
- one more process is needed for life to evolve from probiotic chemistry:
    - inheritance: reproduction gives rise to products that resemble their parent more closely than they resemble random members of the same population
- two possible routes for the origin of life:
    - genetics first: the RNA world
        - no reasonable pathway leading directly from a dilute solution of small molecules to a full-fledged DNA-protein cell has ever been found
            - this created an impasse in spontaneous origin of life until 1987
        - RNA is replicated by RNA polymerases (small RNA replicators exist as viruses today)
        - RNA molecules can replicate without cells when provided with raw materials and a replicase
            - can also act as enzymes called ribozymes comparable to protein enzymes
                - ribozymes: catalyze reactions, including reactions that modify the state of other RNA molecules
                    - self splicing introns: first examples discovered that proves genetics first; have been regarded as primitive forms of splicing machinery for eukaryotic pre-mRNAs
                        - self splicing: occurs for rare introns that form a ribozyme, performing the functions of a spliceosome by RNA alone
                        - intron: any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is not expressed or operative in the final RNA product
        - RNA uniquely combines the capacity to replicate with the capacity to direct metabolism
            - led to the theory of the RNA world: an early ocean populated by self-replicating RNA strands from which cells and eventually all living organisms descended
    - metabolism first:
        - life in Lost City hydrothermal field:
            - potential energy source - chemical disequilibrium at hydrothermal vents:
                - at high pressure and temperature (~150oC) - CO2 dissolved in water is reduced to H2 (exergonic reaction)
                    - high pressure due to depth of ocean
                    - high temp due to convection of geothermal heat through seabed
                - organic synthesis: CO2 dissolved in seawater is reduced by H2 to form a range of organic molecules in anoxic conditions
                    - anoxic: absence of oxygen
        - metabolism:
	substrates	redox reaction	products
electron donor	reduced form of substance A	—oxidation (electron loss)—>	oxidized form of substance A
electron accepter	oxidized form of substance B	—reduction (electron gain)—>	reduced form of substance B
            - electron donor gives electron to electron acceptor and releases energy
                - electron acceptor becomes electron donor and continues reacting according to the redox tower
        - redox tower:
            - bacterial metabolism is based on pairing electron acceptors with electron donors
            - if oxidation of molecule A (left column) is above the reduction of molecule B (right column), the reactions can be coupled into a redox reaction, yielding energy
            - arrows drawn in the redox tower yield energy if they run downward from left to right and the amount of energy released is indicated by the length of the arrow
        - evolution of metabolism:
            1. glycolysis & fermentation (3.5 bya):
                - glucose + 2NAD + 2ADP + 2Pi —(glycolysis)—> pyruvate + 2NADH + 2ATP + 2H2O + 2H+ —(fermentation)—> ethanol + NAD+ (2ATP)
                - glycolysis is the initial stage of energy production
                - a 6-carbon molecule of glucose is broken down into a 3-carbon molecule of pyruvate, which generates energy (stored as ATP) and reducing power (stored as NADH)
                    - pyruvate: simplest of the alpha-keto acids with a carboxylic acid and a ketone functional group
                    - ATP: adenosine triphosphate, molecule that carries energy within cells
                    - NADH: electron transfer molecule; electron donor at top of electron transport chain
                - if oxygen (or some other alternative) is not available, then pyruvate is the final electron acceptor
                - NADH must be re-oxidized to NAD+ as the electron necessary for a new round of glycolysis through a process called fermentation (does not generate energy)
            2. anaerobic respiration (3.45 bya):
                - glycolysis -> oxidation of pyruvate -> citric acid cycle -> electron transport chain 
                - Creducing + SO4- —> Coxidizing + HS- (>>2ATP)
                    - electron transport chain:
                        - electrons can be passed along a series of molecules from more electropositive to more electronegative molecules
                        - energy released in fall of potential energy in high-energy to low-energy molecules/ions can be harvested to do work in the cell
                            - in absence of oxygen (anaerobic) some bacteria can use other alternatives to oxygen as the final electron acceptor:
                                - methanogen -> carbon dioxide
                                - acetogen -> carbon dioxide
                                - sulphate reducer -> sulphate
                                - sulphur reducer -> sulphur
                                - iron reducer -> ferric iron
                                - denitrifier -> nitrate
                - chemiosmotic energy storage by membranes:
                    - lipid bilayer membranes are impermeable to ion; separates electrical charge inside from electrical charge outside
                    - charge imbalance is caused by redox reactions of the electron transport chain that pump cations (H+) across plasma membrane to create an electrochemical gradient
                        - these cations tend to return spontaneously due to the difference in concentration across the membrane
                            - cations return through the ATP synthase channel which drives the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to turn into ATP 
                            - creates a high-energy phosphate bond that can then be hydrolyzed to support biosynthesis
                                - biosynthesis: multi-step enzyme-catalyzed process where substrates are converted into more complex products in living organisms
                - ATP synthase: water mill analogy
                    - bacteria invented the wheel
            3. anoxygenic photosynthesis (3.4 bya): photosynthetic bacteria
                - CO2 + HS- —> CH2O + 2S
            4. oxygenic photosynthesis (2.7 bya): cyanobacteria
                - CO2 + H2O —> CH2O + O2
                - caused the great oxygenation event (oxygen level from 0.0001% —> 21%)
            5. aerobic respiration: evolution of oxygen breathing organisms
                - CH2O + O2 —> CO2 + H2O (~36ATP)
                - electrons are supplied by NAD+ to NADH (most electropositive member of chain) and is passed along a chain of intermediates to the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen (which also received a proton to form water)

                    - heterotroph: uses organic C
                    - photo: light energy
                    - chemo: chemical energy
