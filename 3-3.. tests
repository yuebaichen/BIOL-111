3.3 - non-vascular plants & transition to land 

- summary of origin of photosynthesis:
    1. archaeplastids (plants) acquired photosynthesis via primary endosymbiosis of bacteria
    2. other eukaryotes acquired photosynthesis via secondary endosymbiosis of archaeplastids

- viridiplantae ("green plants"): monophyletic group within archaeplastids 
    - ~500k species
    - consists of:
        1. green algae: dominant photosynthesizers in water
        2. land plants (not all green): dominant photosynthesizers on land
            1. bryophytes: non-vascular plants
            2. tracheophytes: vascular plants

- key evolutionary innovations in plants:
    1. enabled proliferation of new lineages
    2. facilitated access to new habitats & ecological niches

- plantae:
    - chloroplasts containing chlorophyll a+b & B-carotene -> green algae: green plants
        - ability to live on land -> non-vascular plants: land plants (bryophytes)
            - vascular tissue -> seedless plants: vascular plants (tracheophytes)
                - seeds (vs spores) -> gymnosperms: seed plants
                    - flowers -> angiosperms: flowering plants

- green algae:
    - facts:
        1. some plants have flagella & can swim
        2. ~8k species
        3. unicellular & multicellar species
        4. 90% of green algae live in freshwater
        5. main primary producers in freshwater
        6. diverse reproduction: sexual & asexual
    - not land lineage: few exceptions of green algae on land
        1. some lichens
        2. watermelon snow: green algae (but red due to carotenoids to protect from UV)
        3. pathogenic, non-photosynthetic green algae in mammals

- transition to land: basis of food web that support all life on land today
    - land plants are fairly recent (~475 Mya, ~1 billions years from first photosynthetic eukaryote)
    - eras of innovation:
        - 475-416 Mya: origin of land plants: cuticle, spores, sporangia
        - 416-359 Mya: Silurian-Devonian explosion: most major morphological innovations (stomata, vascular tissue, roots, leaves)
        - 359-299 Mya: Carboniferous: mosses were dominant land form on earth
        - 299-145 Mya: gymnosperms abundant: both wet & dry environments covered with green plants for first time
        - 145 Mya-present: angiosperms abundant: diversication of flowering plants
    - major innovations are monophyletic since they only happened once (implies they were not easy)
    - why did plants move onto land? (advantages):
        - huge uncolonized area
        - abundant light
        - readily availabile CO2
        - less herbivory (at the time)
    - why was moving onto land so hard? (challenges):
        - UV Radiation
        - dehydration
        - disperal (find way to disperse progeny)
        - gravity
        - nutrients

- bryophytes: ancestors of the first land plants
    - bryophtes today:
        - >14k species
        - consists of mosses, liverworts, hornworts
    - characteristics:
        1. no vascular tissue (no xylem/phloem)
        2. no roots (can grow on rocks & shallow soil)
        3. absorb water & nutrients from their "leaves"
        4. thin leaves with primitive cuticle & few/no stomata
        5. small & short (also slow-growing): limited by diffusion
        6. generally grow in damp/moist habitats
    - are mosses fragile or tough?:
        - very ecologically important
        - found on all 7 continents
        - only land plants to grow on antarctica
        - very tough despite apparent limitations
    - adaptation of mosses:
        1. able to tolerate periods of desiccation then rapidy rehydrate when water is available
        2. desert mosses grow long filamentous structures to harvest moisture in air
    - key innovations: 
        1. protection from UV: sunscreen
            - plants out of water are exposed to harmful UV rays which damages DNA (less of a problem for algae since water absorbs UV light)
            - algae that survived on land produced compounds that absorb UV light
            - most plants today produce/accumulate UV-absorbing compounds (flavonoids, anthocyanins, carotenoids)
        2. cuticle:
            - watertight sealant/coating covering above-ground plant parts
            - consists of hydrocarbons + lipids + wax, produced by epidermal cells
            - prevents water loss but also inhibits gas exchange
            - earliest nonvascular plants have primitive cuticle with no stomata
        3. reproduction: 
            1. spores encased in tough coat which can: (one of strongest compounds known to humans; protect gametes/reproductive strctures)
                1. resist drying
                2. survive for fairly long periods of time (can be dormant for a long time)
                3. be dispersed by wind (resistant but also lightweight)
            2. gametes (reproductive organs) produced in protective, complex, multicellular structures (fossilized early plants contained specialized reproductive organs)
                - protected gametes from drying & physical damage (herbivory)
                - are present in all modern land plants except angiosperms (structures in flowers perform the same functions)
                - individuals produce distinct male & female reproductive organs
            3. embryos retained on & nourished by parent plant (goes through a bit of development before release)
                - land plants retain embryos instead of shedding them into water/soil
                - in contrast to green algae, zygotes of land plants:
                    - begin development on parent plant
                    - form multicellular embryo structures that remain attached to & can be nourished by parent plant
    - bryophyte reproduction:
        - gametophyte phase dominant in alternation of generations
        - depending on species, gametophytes can be either
            - unisexual: each gametophyte is either male or female
            - bisexual: each gametophyte can produce both male & female
        - reproduction process involves motile sperm that requires thin layer of water on plant to move between gametophytes 
        - life cycle:
            - mature sporophyte undergoes meiosis
            - spores dispersed by wind undergo mitosis
            - spores develop into mature male & female gametophytes
            - sperm from antheridia swim to egg in archegonia
            - sperm & egg undergo fertilization to form diploid zygote
            - zygote undergo mitotsis to develop into mature sporophyte
    - famous moss: ecological significance of moss in Canada
        - sphagnum moss (which forms peat) are a keystone species in peatland ecosystems
            - peat forms when plant material growing year after year does not fully decay/decompose in acidic & anerobic conditions
            - peat bogs create a massive carbon sink 
            - a lot of carbon in Canada are held in northern peatlands
            - peatlands cover 13% of Canada's SA
        - posed challenge to development of Canada (building railways)
        - non-renewable resource (regrows 1mm/year)
        - harvested for gardens (compost) & fuel
    - sphagnum moss & climate change: environmental experiment
        - warming (0 to +9 deg C) & elevated CO2 experiment in peat bogs in Minnesota 
        - experiment targeted the interactive effects of warming & elevated CO2
        - findings:
            1. differences between species: more abundant species show greater resiliance but eventually succumbs & cover drops to 0
            2. patterns over time: cover becomes reduced with longer duration under warming
            3. effects of elevated CO2: does not compensate for warming
        - effects of heat:
            1. dehydration caused by increased evaporation causes stomata to close & hinders photosynthesis
            2. greater respiration: consumes more energy than it produces (thermal acclimation is possible but takes time)
                - rate of respiration increases with warming since enzymes involved in respiration are temperature dependent
                - rate of photosynthesis doesn't change 
            3. less snow cover

- alternation of generations: plants go through haploid phase unlike animals (addition of haploid phase)
    - plants can be multicellular in both haploid & diploid stages
    - life cycle of plants:
        - diploid sporophyte phase:
            - zygote undergoes mitosis (cell division to create 2 identical daughter cells) to replicate & form sporophyte
            - sporophyte produces spores through meiosis (2-step division process to create 4 cells with half the genetic information)
        - haploid gametophyte phase:
            - spores undergo mitosis to become gametophyte consisting of gametes
            - gametes undergo fusion to become zygotes
    - all plants go through alternation of generations but it is only visibly apparent in bryophtes; sporophyte became dominant as plants became more complex
