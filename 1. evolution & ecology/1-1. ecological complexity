L1 - 1.1: ecological complexity

ecology: interactions btwn organisms&env.

4 branches of ecology:
    1. community: interaction btwn species in rel. to env.
        - can be expressed as food webs
        1. 3 categories within food webs:
            1. primary producers: produce organic material from light/chem nrg & inorganic carbon sources
            2. consumers: derives nrg intake from inorganic carbon sources
                1. herbivores: consumes plants
                2. carnivores: consumes flesh of animals
                3. ominvores: consumes both plants&animals
                4. parasites: survives in/on another species at expense of its host
            3. decomposers: break down organic material 
        2. 4 types of community interactions:
            1. predation: one organism preys on another
            2. competition: two organims compete for an insufficient resource
            3. mutualism: rel. btwn two organisms that benefit both
            4. parasitism: one organim takes resources from another, without immediately killing its host
    2. behaviour: animal behaviour in rel. to env.
        - optimal foraging theory: model predicting animal behaviour when searching for food
            - predicts that animals should adopt foraging strategy to maximize ratio of nrg gained to nrg spent
            - should maximize tot nrg gained to maximize fitness
        - 3 main factors influencing behaviour:
            1. abund. of prey types
            2. difficulty to catch (effort)
            3. quality (nutritional value)
        - 4 other factors:
            1. intraspecific competition: members of same species compete for insufficient resource
            2. predation risk: propensity to be predated upon by another (related to fear)
            3. essential nutrients: choices to obtain particular essential nutrients
            4. protection from toxins: choices that could potentially grant protection from toxins (non-related to nrg)
        - bears as ex.
            - prediction: since salmon nutritional value rapidly decreases with time, bears should choose to consume freshest, most nrg-rich salmon
                - bears in deep creek must sacrifice nutritional value of prey despite abund. of prey due to difficulty to catch
    3. ecosystem: flow of nrg&matter through biotic&abiotic components of ecosystem
        - bottom-up: abiotic factors determine abund. of upper trophic levels (via primary producers)
            - diff. nutrients can limit productivity @ diff. times&places
            - nitrogen as ex.
                - nitrogen is often limiting factor in temperate terrestrial envs.
                - nitrogen is very abundant in the air as N2 but is inaccessable to most organisms
                - can be "fixed" into soil by some bacteria & plants
                - still exists shortage of nitrogen for maximal growth
                - proof via experimentation: nitrogen addition via urea significantly boosts plant growth (used as fertilizer)
        - top-down: predators control abund. of lower trophic levels
        - terms:
            - trophic cascade: powerful event that shapes structure of ecosystem of which its effects impacts up&down many trophic levels
            - keystone species: has disproportionately large effect on its natural env. relative to its abund.
    4. population: demographics in rel. to env.
        - annual population trend of pink salmon:
            - 2 year life cycle due to strict 2 year life span
            - generates odd&even runs
        - correlated population cycle of snowshoe hare & lynx:
            - experiment to determine whether trend was driven by: predation, comp btwn lynx, comp btwn hares
                - studied 7 plots of boreal forest: 3 unmanipulated, 1 no lynx, 1 extra food, 1 no lynx & extra food
            - conclusions:
                - hare populations are limited by both predation & food limitation, especially in conjunction
                - when predation & food limitation occur simultaneously, it has much greater effects than either factor independently



EXAM:
    - 4 branches of ecology:
        - ecology: interactions btwn. organisms & env.
        1. community: interaction btwn. species in rel. to env.
            - can be rep. as food web
            - 3 categories within food web:
                1. producers: produce nrg from inorganic material
                2. consumers: nrg intake from other living things
                    1. herbivores: consumes only plants
                    2. carnivores: consumes only flesh
                    3. omnivores: consumes both plants & flesh
                    4. parasites: survives in/on another species at the expense of its host
                3. decomposers: consume dead organic material
            - 4 types of community interactions:
                1. competition: two compete for insufficient resource
                2. predation: one eats other
                3. mutualism: rel. that benefits both
                4. parasitism: one takes resources from other without immediately killing host
        2. behaviour: animal behaviour in rel. to env.
            - optimal foraging theory: predicts animals should forage food to maximize nrg intake while minimizing nrg expenditure to maximize fitness
            - 3 main factors influencing foraging behaviour:
                1. abund.
                2. difficulty to catch
                3. quality
            - 4 other factors influencing foraging behaviour:
                1. intraspecific competition
                2. predation risk
                3. essential nutrients
                4. protection from toxins
        3. ecosystem: flow of nrg & matter through abiotic & biotic components of ecosystem
            1. bottom-up: abiotic factors determine abund. of upper trophic levels
            2. top down: predators control abund. of lower trophic levels
            - trophic cascade: powerful event that changes the structure of an ecosystem & impacts up & down many trophic levels
            - keystone species: species with disproportionately large effect on natural env. in rel. to its abund.
        4. population: demographics in rel. to env.
            - 2 year pink salmon cycle explained by even/odd year runs
            - hare & lynx experiment concluded both predation & food scarcity have a much bigger impact on hare pop. than either factor has alone
