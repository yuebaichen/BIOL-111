4 branches of ecology: interactions btwn. organisms & env.
    1. community: interaction btwn. species in rel. to env.
        - can be rep. as food web
        - 3 categories within food web:
            1. producers: produce nrg from inorganic material
            2. consumers: nrg intake from other living things
                1. herbivores: consumes only plants
                2. carnivores: consumes only flesh
                3. omnivores: consumes both plants & flesh
                4. parasites: survives in/on another species at the expense of its host
            3. decomposers: consume dead organic material
        - 4 types of community interactions:
            1. competition: two compete for insufficient resource
            2. predation: one eats other
            3. mutualism: rel. that benefits both
            4. parasitism: one takes resources from other without immediately killing host
    2. behaviour: animal behaviour in rel. to env.
        - optimal foraging theory: predicts animals should forage food to maximize nrg intake while minimizing nrg expenditure to maximize fitness
        - 3 main factors influencing foraging behaviour:
            1. abund.
            2. difficulty to catch
            3. quality
        - 4 other factors influencing foraging behaviour:
            1. intraspecific competition
            2. predation risk
            3. essential nutrients
            4. protection from toxins
    3. ecosystem: flow of nrg & matter through abiotic & biotic components of ecosystem
        1. bottom-up: abiotic factors determine abund. of upper trophic levels
        2. top down: predators control abund. of lower trophic levels
        - trophic cascade: powerful event that changes the structure of an ecosystem & impacts up & down many trophic levels
        - keystone species: species with disproportionately large effect on natural env. in rel. to its abund.
    4. population: demographics in rel. to env.
        - 2 year pink salmon cycle explained by even/odd year runs
        - hare & lynx experiment concluded both predation & food scarcity have a much bigger impact on hare pop. than either factor has alone

evolution: change in allele freq. across generations
    - 2 ways of studying evolutionary change:
        1. mendelian genetic variation: genotypic variation 
        2. quantitative variation: phenotypic variation
    - 5 key mechanisms of evolution:
        1. mutation: change in genes which can manifest physically (caused by nucleotide matching error by DNA polymerase)
        2. genetic drift: rand. events that change gene pool in population
        3. natural selection: pressure from environment
        4. sexual selection: competition for opposite sex (intra: male-male & inter: female choice)
        5. gene flow: moving of genetic material across diff. populations
        - drunkards walk: mutation (stumbling), genetic drift (helping hand), natural (slope), sexual (hot girl), gene flow (bungee cord) 
    - 3 insights of darwin & wallace:
        1. all organisms have potential for exponential growth yet most pop. are relatively stable: implies lots of death
        2. traits: vary among individuals, influence survival, are heritable
        3. traits the improve survival should inc. freq. or size through time

global change:
    - 6 major forms of global change:
        1. temperature:
            1. droughts & fires
            2. floods & hurricanes
        2. habitat loss
        3. pollution:
            1. plastic
            2. salt (bad for freshwater ecosystems)
            3. noise
            4. light
            5. atmospheric
        4. ocean acidification: dec. in pH in oceans
        5. invasive species
        5. hunting & harvesting
    - 2 scenarios of (mal)adaptation: shifting of optimum
        1. abrupt shift cuts off majority of phenotypic distribution -> possible extinction
        2. gradual shift allows phenotypic distribution to shift along to follow optimum
        - shifting usualy conceptualized as natural selection but can also be sexual
    - 3 ways populations can better match optimum:
        1. move
        - stay but change phenotypes: (characteristics & traits)
            2. plasticity: change in behaviour & physiology
            3. evolution: change in allele freq. & morphology
    - 5 main impacts of global change:
        1. maladaption of organisms
        2. change in traits of species
        3. change in pop. abund.
        4. habitat ranges moving toward poles
        5. inc. freq. of extirpations & extinctions
