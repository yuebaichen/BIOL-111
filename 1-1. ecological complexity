L1 - ecological complexity {1}

#^ecology: study of interactions between organisms and their environment^#

1. branches of ecology {4}:
    (1-> #^community ecology {2, 0, 1}: interactions between species in relation to environment^#
        ((*-> community ecology can be represented as a food web
        ((1-> categories within food webs {3}: (category of an organism is not always clear)
            (((1-> #^primary producer: organism that produces organic material from light/chemical energy^#
            (((2-> #^consumer {4}: any organism that does not produce its own energy^#
                -1) #^carnivore: organism that only eats flesh of animals^#
                -2) #^herbivore: organism that only feed on plants^#
                -3) #^omnivore: organism that feed on both plants and animals^#
                -4) #^parasite: organism that survives in/on another species, at the expense of its host^#
            (((3-> #^decomposers: organism that break down organic material^#
        ((2-> types of community interactions {4}: (INTERSPECFIC)
            -1) #^predation: one organism (predator) kills and consumes another organism (prey)^#
            -2) #^competition: two organisms compete for an insufficient resource^#
            -3) #^mutualism: interaction between species where both benefit^#
            -4) #^parasitism: one organism (parasite) takes resources from another (host) without immediately killing it^#
    (2-> #^behavioural ecology {2}: animal behaviour in relation to environment^#
        ((1-> #^optimal foraging theory {2, 1, 1}: model that predicts how animals behave when searching for food^#
            (((*-> #^the theory’s prediction: animals adopt a foraging strategy that provides the most benefit (energy) for lowest cost; maximizing the net energy gain in order to maximize fitness^#
            (((1-> factors to consider {3}:
                -1) abundance of different prey types
                -2) difficulty to catch of different prey types
                -3) quality (nutritional value) of different prey types
            (((2-> other complications {4}:
                -1) #^intraspecific competition: members of same species compete for limited resources^#
                -2) #^predation risk: propensity to be predated upon by another organism (fear)^#
                -3) #^essential nutrients: choices to obtain particular essential nutrients (non-related to energy)^#
                -4) #^protection from toxins: choices that could potentially protect against toxins (non-related to energy)^#
            (((ex. bears 
                -*) prediction: since nutrition of salmon decreases rapidly after spawning, bears should eat the newest, most energy-rich fish
                    --*) however, they can only do so when catching them is easy
                        --*) bears kill younger/fresher salmon at narrow and shallow creek
                        --*) bears kill older, less nutritious fish at larger and deeper creek
        ((2-> #^ecological specialization {2}: extent of limitation of diet & habitat as a result of evolutionary tradeoffs^#
            -1) #^generalist: have a diverse diet & thrive in a range of habitats^#
            -2) #^specialist: have limited diet & stricter habitat requirements^#
    (3-> #^ecosystem ecology {2}: flow of energy&matter through biotic&abiotic components of ecosystems^#
        ((1-> #^bottom-up control {1, 1}: when abiotic factors (amount of nutrients, sunlight, water) determine abundance of primary producers#^
            (((1-> different nutrients can limit productivity at different times & places
            (((ex. nitrogen is often the limiting factor in temperate terrestrial environments {4}:
                -1) despite air being 78% nitrogen, most nitrogen is in gaseous form N2 which cannot be used by most organisms
                -2) nitrogen can be “fixed” into a more usable form by bacteria in soil or roots of legume plants
                -3) however, there still often a shortage of nitrogen for maximal growth
                -4) proof via experimentation: nitrogen addition during forest fertilization via urea - CO(NH2)2
        ((2-> #^top-down control {2, 1}: when predators control the abundance of lower trophic levels^#
            -ex. proof via experimentation: wolves were hunted to extinction in early 1900s in the Yellowstone ecosystem and caused many documented effects (some dramatic), including a trophic cascade upon their reintroduction in 1995
            -1) #^trophic cascade: powerful event resulting in changes to the structure of an ecosystem of which the results impact up&/down many trophic levels^#
            -2) #^keystone species: species with disproportionately large effect on its natural environment relative to its abundance^#
    (4-> #^population ecology {2}: demographics (births, deaths, structure of population) in relation to the environment^#
        ((1-> pink salmon show 2 year abundance cycles bc they have strict 2 year life cycle -> generates “odd year” & “even year” runs
        ((2-> correlated population cycles of snowshoe hares & lynx {2}:
            -1) correlation due to predation, competition between lynx, competition between hares? {1}:
                -*) experiment setup studying 7 plots in boreal forests: 3 unmanipulated plots for control, 1 no lynx, 1 extra food, 1 extra food and no lynx
            -2) #^conclusion: hare populations are limited by both predation and food availability especially in conjunction; when predation and food limitation occur together, they have a much greater effect than either factor independently^#
