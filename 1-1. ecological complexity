TEST 1:

ecology: interaction btwn organisms&environment

branches of ecology:
    1. community: interaction between organisms in relation to env
        - can be represented as food web
        1. 3 categories within food web:
            1. primary producer: produces organic material from light/chem nrg
            2. consumer: cannot produce its own energy, has to consume other organic sources of carbon
                1. herbivore: consumes plants
                2. carnivore: consumes flesh of animals
                3. omnivore: consumes both plants & aniamls
                4. parasite: survives in/on another species, at the expense of its host
            3. decomposer: breaks down organic material 
    2. behaviour: animal behaviour in relation to env
        1. optimal foraging theory: model predicting animal behaviour when searching for food
            - predicts that animals will adopt strategy to maximize nrg intake while minimizing effort
            1. limiting factors
            2. other factors
                1. intraspecific competition: members of same species compete for limited resource
                2. predation risk: propensity to be predated upon by another (relates to fear)
                3. essential nutrients: choices to obtain essential nutrients (non-related to nrg)
                4. pretection against toxins: choices that could potentially provide protection from toxins (non-related to nrg)
            - bear as example:
                - predication: since nutritional value of salmon decrease rapidly with time, bears should eat the freshest, most nrg-rich fish
                    - bears at shallow creek eat the fresh salmon due to ease of catching
                    - bears at deep creek are forced to sacrifice nutritional value despite equal abundance due to difficulty to catch salmon
        2. ecological specialization: extent of limitation of diet&habitat as result of evolutionary tradeoffs
            1. generalist: diverse diet & can thrive in variety of habitats
            2. specialist: limited diet & stricter habitat requirements
    3. ecosystem: flow of nrg&matter through biotic&abiotic components of ecosystem
        1. bottom-up control: abiotic factors determine abundance of primary producers
        2. top-down control: predators determine abundance of lower trophic levels
            - wolves as example:
                - wolves were hunted to extinction in the early 1900s in Yellowstone
                - resulted in many documented effects (some dramatic) including a trophic cascade upon their reintroduction in 1995
        - terminology:
            1. trophic cascade: powerful event that changes structure of ecosystem of which the effects impacts up&down many trophic levels
            2. keystone species: has disproportionately large effect on natural environment relative to its abundance
    4. population ecology: demographics in relation to env
        1. annual population trends of pink salmon:
            - pink salmon show 2 year life cycles due to their strict 2 year lifespan
            - this generates even&odd runs
        2. correlated population of snowshoe hares & lynx:
            - experiment conducted to determine whether trend is driven by predation, competition btwn lynx, or competition btwn hares:
                - study on 7 plots of boreal forest: 3 unmanipulated plots for control, 1 plot no lynx, 1 plot extra food, 1 plot no lynx & extra food
            - study concluded that hare populations are controlled by predation AND food abundance... ESPECIALLY IN conjunction
                - when predation & food limitation occur together, it has a much greater impact that either factor has individually

TEST 2:

ecology: interactions btwn organisms&env.

branches of ecology:
    1. community: interaction btwn species in rel. to env.
        - can be expressed as food webs
        1. categories within food webs:
            1. primary producers: produce organic material from light/chem nrg & inorganic carbon sources
            2. consumers: derives nrg intake from inorganic carbon sources
                1. herbivores: consumes plants
                2. carnivores: consumes flesh of animals
                3. ominvores: consumes both plants&animals
                4. parasites: survives in/on another species at expense of its host
            3. decomposers: break down organic material 
        2. community interactions: ()
            1. predation: one organism preys on another
            2. competition: two organims compete for an insufficient resource
            3. mutualism: rel. btwn two organisms that benefit both
            4. parasitism: one organim takes resources from another, without immediately killing its host
    2. behaviour: animal behaviour in rel. to env.
        - optimal foraging theory: model predicting animal behaviour when searching for food
            - predicts that animals should adopt foraging strategy to maximize ratio of nrg gained to nrg spent
            - should maximize tot nrg gained to maximize fitness
        - main factors:
            1. abund. of prey types
            2. difficulty to catch (effort)
            3. quality (nutritional value)
        - other factors:
            1. intraspecific competition: members of same species compete for insufficient resource
            2. predation risk: propensity to be predated upon by another (related to fear)
            3. essential nutrients: choices to obtain particular essential nutrients
            4. protection from toxins: choices that could potentially grant protection from toxins (non-related to nrg)
        - bears as ex.
            - prediction: since salmon nutritional value rapidly decreases with time, bears should choose to consume freshest, most nrg-rich salmon
                - bears in deep creek must sacrifice nutritional value of prey despite abund. of prey due to difficulty to catch
    3. ecosystem: flow of nrg&matter through biotic&abiotic components of ecosystem
        - bottom-up: abiotic factors determine abund. of primary producers
            - diff. nutrients can limit productivity @ diff. times&places
            - nitrogen as ex.
                - nitrogen is often limiting factor in temperate terrestrial envs.
                - nitrogen is very abundant in the air as N2 but is inaccessable to most organisms
                - can be "fixed" into soil by some bacteria & plants
                - still exists shortage of nitrogen for maximal growth
                - proof via experimentation: nitrogen addition via urea significantly boosts plant growth (used as fertilizer)
        - top-down: predators control abund. of lower trophic levels
        - terms:
            - trophic cascade: powerful event that shapes structure of ecosystem of which its effects impacts up&down many trophic levels
            - keystone species: has disproportionately large effect on its natural env. relative to its abund.
    4. population: demographics in rel. to env.
        - annual population trend of pink salmon:
            - 2 year life cycle due to strict 2 year life span
            - generates odd&even runs
        - correlated population cycle of snowshoe hare & lynx:
            - experiment to determine whether trend was driven by: predation, comp btwn lynx, comp btwn hares
                - studied 7 plots of boreal forest: 3 unmanipulated, 1 no lynx, 1 extra food, 1 no lynx & extra food
            - conclusions:
                - hare populations are limited by both predation & food limitation, especially in conjunction
                - when predation & food limitation occur simultaneously, it has much greater effects than either factor independently
